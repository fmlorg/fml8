*** ticket status (RT)
                
A Request will always be in one of the following four states:

    Open -- the Request is expecting imminent action a/o updates
 Stalled -- the Request needs a specific action or piece of
            information before it can proceed
Resolved -- the Request has either been answered or successfully
            taken care of, and no longer needs action
    Dead -- the request should not have been in the ticketing system to begin
            with and has been completely purged.

(REQ)

       Another somewhat hardcoded features is the "status" field.
       We're not exactly sure how to use this yet,  but  normally
       use  "stalled" to indicate that this request isn't one can
       make any progress at the moment, thus isn't worth  picking
       from the queue to work on.
