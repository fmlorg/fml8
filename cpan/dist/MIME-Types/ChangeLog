Revision history for Perl extension MIME::Types.

Unless explicitly stated differently are all changes produced by
Mark Overmeer <mimetypes@overmeer.net>

version 1.004: Tue Oct 22 19:22:43 CEST 2002

	- [Dan Puro] sent a reference to a list stored at
	  http://www.indiana.edu/cgi-bin-local/mimetypes.  Most differences
	  are added, but some where competing... and I won.

version 1.003: Wed Oct  2 09:42:58 CEST 2002

	- [Darell Fuhriman] added application/x-rar-compressed and
	  application/x-msdownload

	- [Vladimir V. Kolpakov] set $/ = "\n" on parsing data from
	  inside file, which was written on UNIX and used in Windows.

	- [Dan Puro] added application/wordperfect5.1 extension wpd.

	- [Petri Riihikallio] added .xlt for Excel and .pps/.pot
	  for PowerPoint.

version 1.002: Mon Aug 12 11:40:55 CEST 2002

	- [Jan Kratochvil] added audio/amr and audio/amr-wb to the
	  set of known datatypes.  Types defined by rfc3267

version 1.001: Tue Jun 18 13:39:56 CEST 2002

	- Brown paper-bag release.  Accidentally, code was installing
	  itself as MIME::MIME::Types

version 1.00: Tue Jun 18 13:27:16 CEST 2002

	- No real changes for some time now, so released a stable with
	  version of 1.00

	- Doc typo:  MIME::Types->extension must be MIME::Types->mimeTypeOf

	- Overloaded comparison of $mimetype with string now works.  Before,
	  only two objects could be compared.

version 0.16: Tue Feb 19 12:08:51 CET 2002

	- MIME::Type->simplified('text') will return 'text/plain'

	- MIME::Types->type($mime) will return undef for illegal $mime

version 0.15: Wed Jan 23 21:22:26 CET 2002

	- [Dirk Lutsebaeck] contributed a few mime-types.  I am open
	  to receive more improvements.

	- Refrased the reason for removal of import_mime_types, a
	  residual of the pre-0.10 version of this module.

	- Changed MIME::Type::mainType() into MIME::Type::mediaType() to
          follow the terminology of the RFC more closely.  The old name
	  is still usable.

	- Added MIME::Types::addType

	- Added overloading stringify and comparison to MIME::Type objects.
	  some tests in t/11typeol.t

version 0.14:  Sat Dec  1 13:56:51 CET 2001
        - Did a bad job (it's hard to support backwards compat if you run
          5.6)  Thanks to [Tatsuhiko Miyagawa]

version 0.13:  Sat Dec  1 01:53:20 CET 2001
	- [Slaven Radic] back-port to 5.005

version 0.12:  Wed Nov 28 09:39:44 CET 2001
	Mark Overmeer took the namespace over from Jeff Okamoto
	- In scalar context MIME::Types::type will return only the
	  first type that fits.

version 0.10:  Sat Nov  3 22:46:22 2001
	Mark Overmeer
	- Total redesign of the interface, object oriented with two
	  classes: the MIME::Types and the MIME::Type.
	- No seperate mime.types file anymore, but included inside
	  MIME::Types, such that installation is much easier.
	- Merged-in apache's mime types 1.3.14
	- New test files.
	- Modernized test.pl into t/30export.t
