NAME
    IO-stringy - I/O on in-core objects like strings and arrays

SYNOPSIS
        IO::
        ::AtomicFile   adpO  Write a file which is updated atomically     ERYQ
        ::Lines        bdpO  I/O handle to read/write to array of lines   ERYQ
        ::Scalar       RdpO  I/O handle to read/write to a string         ERYQ
        ::ScalarArray  RdpO  I/O handle to read/write to array of scalars ERYQ
        ::Wrap         RdpO  Wrap old-style FHs in standard OO interface  ERYQ
        ::WrapTie      adpO  Tie your handles & retain full OO interface  ERYQ

DESCRIPTION
    This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
    and object-oriented i/o) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
    particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

    If you have access to tie(), these classes will make use of the
    IO::WrapTie module to inherit a convenient new_tie() constructor. It
    also exports a nice wraptie() function.

    In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile which
    may be used to painlessly create files which are updated atomically.

    And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose
    exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a blessed
    object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax
    and stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed you a
    string, a globref, or a FileHandle.

INSTALLATION
    You know the drill...

        perl Makefile.PL
        make test
        make install

CHANGE LOG
    Version 1.216   (2000/09/28)
        IO::Scalar and IO::ScalarArray now inherit from IO::Handle. I
        thought I'd remembered a problem with this ages ago, related to the
        fact that these IO:: modules don't have "real" filehandles, but the
        problem apparently isn't surfacing now. If you suddenly encounter
        Perl warnings during global destruction (especially if you're using
        tied filehandles), then please let me know! *Thanks to B. K. Oxley
        (binkley) for this.*

        Nasty bug fixed in IO::Scalar::write(). Apparently, the offset and
        the number-of-bytes arguments were, for all practical purposes,
        *reversed.* You were okay if you did all your writing with print(),
        but boy was *this* a stupid bug! *Thanks to Richard Jones for
        finding this one. For you, Rich, a double-length haiku:*

                  simply not equivalent   
               to FISH EATS BABY

        New sysread and syswrite methods for IO::Scalar. *Thanks again to
        Richard Jones for this.*

    Version 1.215   (2000/09/05)
        Added 'bool' overload to '""' overload, so object always evaluates
        to true. (Whew. Glad I caught this before it went to CPAN.)

    Version 1.214   (2000/09/03)
        Evaluating an IO::Scalar in a string context now yields the
        underlying string. *Thanks to B. K. Oxley (binkley) for this.*

    Version 1.213   (2000/08/16)
        Minor documentation fixes.

    Version 1.212   (2000/06/02)
        Fixed IO::InnerFile incompatibility with Perl5.004. *Thanks to many
        folks for reporting this.*

    Version 1.210   (2000/04/17)
        Added flush() and other no-op methods. *Thanks to Doru Petrescu for
        suggesting this.*

    Version 1.209   (2000/03/17)
        Small bug fixes.

    Version 1.208   (2000/03/14)
        Incorporated a number of contributed patches and extensions, mostly
        related to speed hacks, support for "offset", and WRITE/CLOSE
        methods. *Thanks to Richard Jones, Doru Petrescu, and many others.*

    Version 1.206   (1999/04/18)
        Added creation of ./testout when Makefile.PL is run.

    Version 1.205   (1999/01/15)
        Verified for Perl5.005.

    Version 1.202   (1998/04/18)
        New IO::WrapTie and IO::AtomicFile added.

    Version 1.110
        Added IO::WrapTie.

    Version 1.107
        Added IO::Lines, and made some bug fixes to IO::ScalarArray. Also,
        added getc().

    Version 1.105
        No real changes; just upgraded IO::Wrap to have a $VERSION string.
