  Crypt::UnixCrypt - perl-only implementation of the crypt(3) function.

        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

This module is for all those poor souls whose perl port answers to the
use of crypt() with the message `The crypt() function is unimplemented
due to excessive paranoia.'.

It was tested under Perl 5.004 and 5.005.

To install this module, please run:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

For more information on the module, please see the POD documentation
inside UnixCrypt.pm. ("perldoc Crypt::UnixCrypt", once it is installed.)
