2.05

  - blockparas uses <p> as its inner tag, instead of <div>
  - blockparas and blockcode are consolidated when they are found in
    groups.  blocklines are left out because they're so literal.

2.04

  - Fixed bug when run under 5.8.1 and always-random hashes.
  - Emacs macros enhanced.

2.03

  - Working toward standards compliance.
    - blockcode now uses pre tags.
    - blockparas and blockquotes use div tags.
  - Remove dependency on Regexp::Common.
  - XHTML 1.1 valid output.
  - CSS Class names for every option type.
  - Fixed a but in tables where duplicate breakpoints were being
    entered (reported by Dan Wright).
  - Fixed but in tables where breakpoints of two spaces were ignored.
  - text2html command line utility ensures output ends in newline.
  - Add example emacs macros for modifying regions with text2html.

2.02

  - Added command line utility called 'text2html'.  It will be
    installed when this version of HTML::FromText is built and
    installed.
  - Fixed but in blockcode, wasn't preserving spaces.

2.01

  - Fixed URLS, they were broken because Regexp::Common::URI was much
    too restrictive (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bullets. Mixing '*' and '-' were previously allowed and caused
    problems. They can't be mixed within paragraphs that are bulleted
    lists any longer (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bold and underline, they were broken and matching, but not
    substituting, across line boundaries. They no longer match across
    line boundaries (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Fixed bold and underline, they were too greedy.  Now they require
    some non-word character before and after them (or the beginning or
    ending of a line). (reported by Wim Kerkhoff).
  - Nasty bug in lists where a nested list can cause an infinite loop
    when bullets don't line up quite right vertically (reported by Wim
    Kerkhoff).

2.00

  - Initial release as complete rewrite of version 1.005 by GDR.
  - Inadvertently created a new feature, nested bulleted and
    numbered lists.
