WHAT IS THIS ?

This is MIME::Lite::HTML, a module which provide routine 
to transform a HTML page in a MIME::Lite mail

The job done is:

 + Get the file (LWP)
 + Parse page to find include images
 + Attach them to mail with adequat cid
 + Include external CSS,Javascript file
 + Replace relative url with absolute one

It can be used by example in a HTML newsletter. You make a classic HTML page, 
and give just url to MIME::Lite::HTML.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT ?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains
this README file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you can't do that, you can put HTML.pm file in
directory $root/MIME/Lite/HTML.pm and then put use lib
$root in your program (make same thing if you haven't MIME-Lite
module).
So it give:
$root/MIME/Lite/HTML.pm
$root/MIME/Lite.pm

and in your script:

#!/usr/bin/perl
$root='/home/alian/mylibperl'
use lib $root;
use MIME::Lite;
use MIME::Lite::HTML;

REQUIREMENT ?

libnet, MIME::Lite

DOCUMENTATION ?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file
HTML.pm in POD format

When you install MIME::Lite::HTML, the MakeMaker program
will automatically install the manual pages for you
(on Unix systems, type "man MIME::Lite::HTML").

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
