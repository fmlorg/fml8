Jcode:
------

This is a Perl extension interface to convert Japanese text.

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, create
the Makefile by running 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make', 'make
test', and if successful 'make install'.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install these modules.
Further documentation is embedded in the individual modules.
