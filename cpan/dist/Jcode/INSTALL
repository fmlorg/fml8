To install
==========

Unix with a compiler
--------------------

  Do the following via web

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Macintosh
---------

  Run "mac_install.pl" just once.  Make sure you have "site_perl"
  folder where your MacPerl folder resides.  If not, create one before
  you run this script.

Windows (ActivePerl)
--------------------

  Run "win_install.pl" just once.  Make sure you have "site\lib"
  folder where your ActivePerl folder resides.  If not, create one 
  before you run this script.

Mac, Win, RedHat  Linux with just default packages installed...
---------------------------------------------------------------
(or any other platforms where no compiler is available)

  Just copy Jcode.pm and Jcode directory (folder) into perl's lib
directory.

  To find where the heck that lib folder is, run this small perl
  script.

  print join("\n", @INC);


__END__
