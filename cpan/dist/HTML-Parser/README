OVERVIEW

The HTML-Parser distribution is is a collection of modules that parse
and extract information from HTML documents.  The modules present in
this collection are:

  HTML::Parser - The parser base class.  It receives arbitrary sized
        chunks of the HTML text, recognizes markup elements, and
        separates them from the plain text.  As different kinds of markup
        and text are recognized, the corresponding event handlers are
        invoked.

  HTML::Entities - Provides functions to encode and decode text with
        embedded HTML &lt;entities&gt;.

  HTML::HeadParser - A lightweight HTML::Parser subclass that extracts
        information from the <HEAD> section of an HTML document.

  HTML::LinkExtor - An HTML::Parser subclass that extracts links from
        an HTML document.

  HTML::PullParser - An alternative interface to the basic parser
        that does not require event driven programming.

  HTML::TokeParser - An HTML::PullParser subclass with fixed
        token setup and methods for extracting text.  Many simple
        parsing needs are probably best attacked with this module.

In addition take a look at the HTML-Tree package that build on
HTML::Parser to create and extract information from HTML syntax trees
(similar to HTML DOM).


PREREQUISITES

If you intend to use the HTML::HeadParser you probably want to install
libwww-perl too.
