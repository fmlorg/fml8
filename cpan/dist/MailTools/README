=== README for MailTools

MailTools is a set of Perl modules related to mail applications.
These modules are very old (partially written before MIME!).  If you
start to write a new e-mail application, consider to use MailBox
instead (http://perl.overmeer.net/mailbox/)  It is a little harder
to learn, but at least implements all RFCs correctly.

You require perl 5.8.1 or later to use this library.  When your Perl
is older, then use version 1.xx.

You install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

There are also some demo scripts (see README.demos)
Please report any bugs/suggestions to
