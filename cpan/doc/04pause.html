<h3><a id="status" name="status">Status of this document</a></h3>

This document is mirrored on CPAN as <i>CPAN</i>/modules/04pause.html.

<h3><a id="upload" name="upload">Uploading</a></h3>

<p>A server dedicated to collect the work of perl authors is a <a
href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/">Perl Authors Upload Server
(PAUSE)</a>. PAUSE provides personal directories and enables their
owners to upload their work into that directory themselves. The
procedure of uploading is trivial and needs no explanation here.
You'll understand it as soon as you have access to the PAUSE. There's
only one thing you need to know as soon as possible:</p>

<blockquote>

<b>Please,</b> make sure the filename you choose contains a <b>version
number</b>. For security reasons you will never be able to upload a
file with identical name again. This strict requirement does have one
exception: documentation files may be overwritten. There's a simple
regular expression that draws the line between docu und code:
<code>/(README|readme|\.html|\.txt)$/</code>. Filenames matching this
RE can be uploaded as often as you like. By the way: it is highly
appreciated, if your packages come tarred and gzipped with a
Makefile.PL, so they can be installed in a standard way.

</blockquote>

<p>The upload server is not very well connected. Please don't mirror
from there. The <a
href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/">funet</a> server in
Finland mirrors every hour the new incoming stuff, so please try to
download from there or from other CPAN sites.</p>


<h3><a id="registering" name="registering"></a>Register yourself</h3>

<p>Registered developers have a unique username and a home directory in
the <i>authors/id/</i> tree of CPAN. The write access to that
directory is password protected.</p>

<p>If you have written a module, script, or documentation, if you have
some porting material or patches you would like to contribute to the
archive, send the following to the maintainers at modules@perl.org
(Note: your email will be made publicly available)</p>

<ul>
  <li> your name</li>
  <li> your email address</li>
  <li> your homepage if you have one</li>
  <li> your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9
characters long, all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed.</li>
  <li> a short description of what you're planning to contribute</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be notified by email about your registration. Please allow
three weeks for proceeding, which should be the maximum during
vacation time. Normally we hope to register you within a week. All
mails to modules@perl.org is archived at <a
href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules</a>.
modules@perl.org isn't a mailing list, just an alias for the
maintainers of the Perl 5 modules list. Please do not subscribe. Visit
the archive instead.</p>

<h3><a id="menu" name="menu"></a>Visit PAUSE</h3>

<p>As soon as you have a password (see <a
href="#registering">registering</a>) you are enabled to use some <a
href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery">forms to interact with
the PAUSE database</a> (<a
href="http://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery">Non-SSL version</a>). You
can add files to your home directory, edit your name, email, and
homepage address, delete your files, change your password on PAUSE,
etc.</p>

<p>If you haven't got a password yet or have forgotten it, please visit
<a href="https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=mailpw"
>https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=mailpw</a> (<a
href="http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=mailpw"
>Non-SSL version</a>) for further instructions.</p>

<p>Please, whenever you exchange email with the maintainers of PAUSE,
mention either your userid or the name you used when you registered.</p>

<h3><a id="duties" name="duties">Your duties, the basics, traps</a></h3>

We trust that you have read the module list top down and bottom up and
back again and that you regularly check out uploads to CPAN and that
you have been watching CPAN activities for a while to have an
impression of how things fit together. It usually boils down to
(slogan shamelessly stolen and adapted from sudo(1)):

<ol>
  <li> Think, better even <b>talk</b> before you upload</li>
  <li> Respect the namespace of others</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="namespace" name="namespace">Register your namespace!</a></h3>

<p><b>Please,</b> talk to other people (comp.lang.perl.modules,
modules@perl.org or any mailing list that fits your problem domain)
before you decide upon the namespace you're going to use for your
module. Usually it's not considered the perl way to have beaurocratic
conventions, but when it comes to namespace pollution, there is the
need of coordination. Just like the InterNIC has to care for unique
names for internet hosts, somebody has to (sort of) guarantee
uniqueness, consistency, and sanity of module names. The <a
href="00modlist.long.html">modulelist</a> is the place where all
currently registered module names can be found and the email address
<b>modules@perl.org</b> is an alias for a hand full of experienced
volunteers who maintain the module list and--time permitting--try to
give advice for the appropriate namespace for your modules.</p>

<p>Please consider the namespace you're going to occupy with all due
sensitivity. Discuss it in the appropriate fora. Read what the <a
href="00modlist.long.html#2)Guidelinesfor">modulelist</a> has to say
about this. Pay special attention to the hints about <i>cutesy
names</i>. Reading these sections carefully will help you and us to
greatly improve the usefulness of the CPAN and avoid cumbersome
renaming at a later date.</p>

<blockquote> Also: think carefully and honestly whether your module
would be better off if it were integrated as an option into an already
existing module. Sometimes it is for the best to put aside personal
glory and join a collaborative effort: Perl itself is a good example
of this. Contact the author of an existing module and ask whether your
new features would fit into his framework. Even if you in the end
decide to release the module as your very own, you really should know
your 'competition', that is, know all the similar modules and the
features they offer. Maybe you can learn from them, maybe you can help
the users of your module better by giving them an overview about
similar modules.</blockquote>

<p>And please do consult the archives of modules@perl.org before you
post a module proposal. The fulltext search capabilities of the
archive should help you to find similar suggestions and contact
addresses. modules@perl.org is low volume, so your search in the
archive is quite targetted. <b>modules@perl.org</b> is not a mailing
list. Please do not try to subscribe. We do not want to establish yet
another perl mailing list. If we encounter hot topics, we move the
discussion to the appropriate mailing lists. The traffic on
<b>modules@perl.org</b> is archived at <a
href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/</a>.
The module list maintainers themselves are mostly
lurkers. You need not wait for a response. Generally a lack of
response can be taken as acceptance of the module name being
proposed.</p>

<p>When you're done with all your preparations, considerations, and
investigations, visit the PAUSE and fill in the form for a new module
namespace. Take your time filling in the rationale of the module
proposal. Consider, your form will be posted to modules@perl.org too,
so other developers will probably stumble over this description many
years later. The better the decription, the better the chances that
your module will actually be used.</p>

<p>You need not wait for approval. You can upload anytime, even before
you fill in the form. Uploading and registering are only loosely
coupled.</p>

<p>The indexes that are maintained automatically on CPAN all double check
if the module names that are used in the uploaded packages are
registered. The indexer unwraps all packages and scans the source code
(namely all <code>*.pm</code> files) for package declarations. You run
the <b>risk of being ignored</b> by the index generator if you do not
talk to the modulelist maintainers about the namespace you are
using.</p>

<h3><a id="conventions" name="conventions">Other conventions you
should know about</a></h3>

<p>Do not upload the <b>READMEs</b> that are integrated in your distribution
files. PAUSE is designed to take care of unwrappig your file with tar
or zip, registering all the modules it finds in there, and placing the
readme file (i.e. a file with the name <code><b>README</b></code> in
the top level directory of your package) into your directory. PAUSE
will change the name of the file to
<code><i>package-name</i><b>.readme</b></code>. It should do so within
a few hours after your upload.</p>

<p>Please make sure all your <code>*.pm</code> files contain a
<b><code>$VERSION</code></b> variable that conforms to the CPAN rules, i.e.
the complete computation of $VERSION must take place on the one first
line within the module that assigns to it. You can test if this is the
case by running</p>

<blockquote><code>perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le 
'print MM->parse_version(shift)' 'file'</code></blockquote>

<p>on the filenames in question. The CPAN indexer will run this code
within a Safe compartement.</p>

<p>The automatic integration of your work into several <b>indexes</b> and
directory trees is not always in accordance with what you desire. If
you want to <b>prevent propagation</b> to places outside of your
directory, simply choose a filename that matches
<b><code>/\d\.\d+_\d/</code></b>, i.e. something that looks like
derived from a perl subversion number (maybe because it <i>is</i> a
perl subversion). PAUSE will leave such distributions untouched: no
readme will be extracted, no index will be updated, no symlinks will
be created.</p>

<p>Any distribution that arrives at PAUSE is checked for <b>package names</b>
contained in the distribution. A package name that arrives for the
first time is automatically assigned either to the author who
submitted it or to user <i>perl</i> if the distribution file is a perl
distribution. A package name that has already been used before must be
submitted by its author, otherwise PAUSE will trigger a warning to the
administrator. That way PAUSE will prevent accidental usage of a
package namespace by more than one author.</p>

<p>Be prepared that very soon after your upload your module will be
tested on dozens of architectures by the never tired <a
href="http://www.perl.org/cpan-testers/results.cgi">cpan-testers</a>.
This helpful lot will send their findings to their mailing list and
collect the results in a database. If they find problems, they try to
diagnose or even solve them and inform you about their findings. So be
prepared to get mail from them before you have closed the buffer in
your editor.</p>


<h3><a id="services" name="services"></a>Related services on PAUSE</h3>

<p>The interdependence between metadata generators, metadata files,
database tables, and human intervention are as follows:</p>

<h3>Modulelist Maintainance</h3>

The <a href="#namespace">above</a> described <a
href="00modlist.long.html">Module List</a> is the heart. It is
maintained manually and all modules listed there have to go through
the <a href="#namespace">standard approval procedure</a>.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="5" align="center">

On a more or less regular basis, the Module List in <a
href="00modlist.long.html">HTML</a> and <a
href="00modlist.long.txt.gz">TXT</a> format and a <a
href="03modlist.data.gz">machine readable representation</a> are
uploaded to CPAN.

</td>
<td colspan="7" align="center">

Jon Orwant is on the board of the module list maintainance group. He's
maintaining a document with a different, considerably more verbose
view on the evolving modules scene, <a
href="../CPAN.html">CPAN.html</a>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="12" align="center">
<h3>Authors Registration</h3>

The maintainers of the Module List do not only register modules'
namespaces, they also register new authors and assign them a password
that enables them to upload to the CPAN.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="6" align="center">

Two documents are available about authors. <a
href="../authors/00whois.html">00whois.html</a> is a list of authors,
mailing lists and mailing list archives in HTML format,

</td>

<td colspan="6" align="center">
and <a
href="../authors/01mailrc.txt.gz">01mailrc.txt.gz</a> is a smaller
list intended to be used as a .mailrc file. Both files are maintained
automatically.

</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="12" align="center">
<h3>Upload Scanner</h3>

When new files arrive on the PAUSE, an Upload Scanner program scans
the new files and categorizes them according to their contents. It
tries to detect namespace clashes and to keep track of version
numbers.

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="4" align="center">

The document <a href="01modules.index.html">01modules.index.html</a>
lists only the most recent distribution files that contain the latest
of any given module that is available on CPAN. A second version of
this document is also available that is <a
href="01modules.mtime.html">sorted by modification date</a>. Both are
maintained by the scanner automatically.

</td> <td colspan="4" align="center">The listing <a
href="02packages.details.txt.gz">02packages.details.txt</a> is also
produced automatically. It is intended for programs but sometimes is a
valuable information for humans too. It simply lists the current
version number and the distribution file for all packages found on
CPAN.

</td> <td colspan="4" align="center">There are also two symlink trees of
modules maintained automatically. One is based on the basenames of the
packages involved: <a href="by-module">by-module</a> and the other one
devides the modules by the chapters of the Module List: <a
href="by-category">by-category</a>. </td> </tr> </table>


<h3><a id="ssl" name="ssl"></a>SSL support on PAUSE</h3>

<p>PAUSE supports both http and https (SSL). Please try PAUSE over an SSL
connection if you can. For our firewall impaired developers we will
keep up the http server for the time being. So if you have
difficulties accessing https, you can always fall back to http, but
using SSL greatly improves your and PAUSE's security.</p>

<p>PAUSE's private key is not registered with any certificate
authority, so when you access the SSL channel for the first time, your
browser will most likely complain that it <i>does not recognize the
authority who signed its Certificate</i>. You can ignore this caveat.
The fingerprint of the self-signed certificate that expires on
2003-05-20 is
<code>0E:E2:E9:AC:81:D0:DC:80:81:25:E5:BA:66:32:33:E5</code></p>

<h3><a id="credits" name="credits"></a>Software</h3>

<p>The software running PAUSE consists of a database, which is driven
by <a href="http://www.tcx.se/">mysql</a> and a <a
href="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</a> server with <a
href="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/SSL/">Ben-SSL</a>. Besides many of
the perl standard modules like CGI, Data::Dumper, Text::Wrap, File,
Directory, and IO modules, PAUSE itself uses lots of modules from the
CPAN. For a complete list, feel free to visit <a
href="http://pause.perl.org/perl-status">http://pause.perl.org/perl-status</a>.
Also a lot of work is done by the mirror program by Lee McLoughlin,
available from the CPAN scripts/ftpstuff directory.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you for your great contributions!</p>
