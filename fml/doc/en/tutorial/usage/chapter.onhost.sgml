	What can we do on the mailing list server host ?
	</title>


<para>
On the host which serves ML driver, 
you can use CUI and edit all configuration files as you like.
It implies you are the greatest administrator :)

	On the host
	</title>

<para>
You need no confirmation in using makefml.
</para>

<para>
Person who can login the host of mailing list server has all
priviledge for all ML's on the host.
So, He/She can edit all configuration files.
But He/She may do wrong operations.
</para>

<para>
To avoid careless miss operations, in usual cases you should use CUI
(makefml or fml) to configure fml.  Of course you can edit files
directly if you can understand fml structures. By default we recommend
you should use CUI even on the host.
</para>

<para>
fml command is same as makefml command except for the argument order.
<screen>
makefml COMMAND ML OPTIONS
fml     ML COMMAND OPTIONS
</screen>
Please either as you like.

special cases, we should unify all functions into makefml/fml command

If the data is not related to the specific ML, for example,
see the module manual, aliases on the host,
