<para>
Consider elena ML.  Send the command mail to elena-ctl@fml.org which
is the address for command mail.  MTA receives the mail and finally
kicks off /usr/local/libexec/fml/command program.  This program
receives the mail (command mail) from STDIN , processes the requests
and sends back the result to the sender.
The mail to send back is passed to MTA for delivery via SMTP.

<link linkend="message.reply">
