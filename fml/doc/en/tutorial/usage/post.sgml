<para>

fml boot loader

boots off in this way.
</para>


<para>
libexec/loader reads etc/fml/main.cf firstly.
Suppose $fml_vesrion is defined as current-20010501 in main.cf.
&fml8; resolves $fml_version from it and determines the library path
as /usr/local/lib/fml/current-20010501/.
&fml8; loads perl modules under it.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; sets up @INC properly, fml loader loads FML::Process::Switch
module and check $0.  fml knowns the role from $0.  In this case of
distribute, fml loads FML::Process::Distribute module and processes
distribution.
