	Example: Boot Sequence Of Distribute Process
	</title>

<para>
<link linkend="bootloader">
fml boot loader
</link>
boots off in the following way.
</para>

<para>
/usr/local/libexec/fml/distribute command is symlink-ed to
/usr/local/libexec/fml/loader. These files are same.
</para>

<para>
/usr/local/libexec/fml/loader reads /usr/local/etc/fml/main.cf
firstly. $fml_vesrion such as "current-20010501" is defined
 in the main.cf. &fml8; resolves $fml_version from it and determines the
library path as /usr/local/lib/fml/current-20010501/.  &fml8; loads
perl modules under it.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; sets up @INC properly. fml loader loads FML::Process::Switch
module and check $0 (process name). fml knows the process role from
$0.  In this case of distribute, fml loads FML::Process::Distribute
module (defined as /usr/local/etc/fml/$fml_version/modules), 
switch itself to it and processes distribution.
