	Back Up Of Configurations
	</title>


<para>
To preserve &fml8; configurations, back up the following two directories:
<screen>
/usr/local/etc/fml/
$ml_home_prefix	(e.g. /var/spool/ml/, domain specific)
</screen>
Attention:
These directories holds all articles, log files and others et.al.
</para>

<para>
It is better to back up MTA configurations, too. 
For example, /etc/postfix in the case of Postfix.
</para>

<para>
In summary, the following three (generally speaking 2 + number of
domains fml8 operatates) are targets.
<screen>
/etc/postfix/
/usr/local/etc/fml/
$ml_home_prefix	(e.g. /var/spool/ml/)
</screen>
</para>

	Back Up &fml8; Configurations
	</title>

<para>
To back up &fml8; configurations, it is enough to back up the
following two directories. But it is too large since they contains
articles, log files and all contents.
<screen>
/usr/local/etc/fml/
$ml_home_prefix	(e.g. /var/spool/ml/, domain specific)
</screen>
</para>

<para>
The hard disk is cheap. So it is safe to preserve all contents as
could as possible.
</para>

<para>
If you preserve only configuratoins, it is enough to back up the
following files.
</para>

	<title>
	Configuration Files To Back Up
	</title>

<para>
It is useful to make a list of targets based on the file naming
convension.
</para>

<para>
In the case of &fml8;, a file with .cf extension is a configuration
file.
The format of .cf file is 
<screen> 
key = value
</screen> 
style. This style configuration files follow
<screen>
/usr/local/etc/fml/main.cf
/usr/local/etc/fml/site_default_config.cf
/EACH_ML_HOME_DIRECTORY/config.cf
</screen>
et.al.
</para>

<para>
Configuration files with other syntax are
<screen>
/usr/local/etc/fml/mime_component_filter
/usr/local/etc/fml/ml_home_prefix
</screen>
This type of files are space separeted.
</para>

<para>
/usr/local/etc/fml/ contains only configuration files.
So back up all under them.
</para>

	<title>
	Address List To Back Up
	</title>

<para>
Lists of mail addresses are 
<screen>
/ML_HOME_DIRECTORY/members*
/ML_HOME_DIRECTORY/recipients*
</screen>
Article delivery uses both recipients and members. For other roles,
&fml8; uses members-$role and recipients-$role. So, back up all
members* and recipients* files.
</para>

<para>
Remote administration by command mail (admin command mail) uses 
the following password files
<screen>
/ML_HOME_DIRECTORY/etc/passwd-$role
</screen>
. Back up /ML_HOME_DIRECTORY/etc/ too.
</para>

	<title>
	Back Up All Files Except For Some Large Directories.
	</title>

<para>
It is easy to back up all files except for the following large
directories. They contains large data or temporary files.
<screen>
spool	articles
tmp	temporary files
var	useful data
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you use rsync, rsync --exclude is useful.
