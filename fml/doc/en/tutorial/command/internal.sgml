	How differ coding style among &fml4; and &fml8;
	</title>

<para>
Consider "help" command an an example of command,
which sends back help message to the sender.
</para>

<para>
In the case of &fmldevel;, the main code of help command locates at
FML::Command::User::help class. This class is called by
FML::Process::Command via AUTOLOAD of FML::Command.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
All commands are implemented at either of FML::Command::User
FML::Command::Admin classes. Both CUI (makefml, fml) and GUI (CGI)
uses FML::Command::Admin class. Instead command mail users both
classes according to the context.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
The real content of help command is process() method in
FML::Command::User::help class.
<screen>
sub process
{
    my ($self, $curproc, $optargs) = @_;
    my $config    = $curproc->{ config };
    my $charset   = $config->{ reply_message_charset };
    my $help_file = $config->{ help_file };

    # template substitution: kanji code, $varname expansion et. al.
    my $params = {
        src         => $help_file,
        charset_out => $charset,
    };
    my $help_template = $curproc->prepare_file_to_return( $params );

    if (-f $help_template) {
        $curproc->reply_message( {
            type        => "text/plain; charset=$charset",
            path        => $help_template,
            filename    => "help",
            disposition => "help",
        });
    }
    else {
        croak("no help file ($help_template)\n");
    }
}
</screen>
where $curproc is an object, which type is hash reference.
It corresponds to %Envelope of &fml4;.
It contains several references to objects for this process.
For exmple, variable $config is an object holding configuration variables.
</para>

<para>
prepare_file_to_return() converts the message language and expands the
arguments in the message templates.
 </para>

<para>
$curproc->reply_message() inserts the specified mesage string into the
message queue of this process on memory.
</para>

<para>
The error/log messages queued in on memory are aggergated to one
message at the last of the current process. Mail::Delivery class
handles the aggregation and send it. If needed, the aggregator handles
text strings and multipart properly to build one message.
</para>

<para>
This mechanism is same as Notify() of &fml4; but the last aggregator
is different.
</para>

<para>
FYI: commands such as "get" for the file manipulation uses the same
message queuing mechanism. Notify() sends back immediately. This is
different from &fml4;'s Notify() fundamentally.
</para>
