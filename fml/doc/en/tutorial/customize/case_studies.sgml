Anybody can post to this ML since customers send mails to this address.
<screen>
post_restrictions		=	permit_anyone
</screen>
In this case, anybody including system special accounts e.g. root,
postmaster can post.

<para>
Disable almost all filters since a lot of customer messages looks
something wrong.
<screen>
use_article_filter		=	no
</screen>
</para>

over million.
<screen>

</screen>
.
</para>

<para>
Allow the use of command mail, which comes only from the specific
domain (my domain e.g. example.co.jp).  This hook enables it.
<screen>
$command_verify_request_end_hook = q{
        my $cred = $curproc->credential();
        my $from = $cred->sender();

        unless ($from =~ /\@example\.co\.jp/i) {
                $curproc->stop_this_process();
                LogError("deny command request from $from");
        }
