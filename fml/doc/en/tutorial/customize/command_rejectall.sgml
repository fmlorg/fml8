	Case Study: Disable Command Mail
	</title>

<para>
It is most safe to remove command mail entries from aliases.
</para>

<para>
Another 2nd best solution follows:
<screen>
use_command_mail_function	=	no
</screen>
In this case, /usr/local/libexec/fml/command runs once but does not
work and ends as soon as possible.
</para>

<para>
The following solution may be possible.
<screen>
use_command_mail_function = yes

command_mail_restrictions = reject
</screen>
When fml receives the incoming command mail, 
it inform the rejection to the sender in all cases.
</para>

<para>
This configuration works but it evalutates each line.
It is useless.
