<para>
Consider asymmetric case of member list (list of persons who can post)
and recipient list.
</para>

<para>
Firstly, remove primary_member_maps from $member_maps.  Instead, add
$ml_home_dir/members-mailmag who can post to $member_maps.
<screen>
member_maps	=	$ml_home_dir/members-mailmag
</screen>
</para>

<para>
In this case, when a new user is subscribed, the user address is added
to both $ml_home_dir/members and $ml_home_dir/recipinets.
But $member_maps is defined as $ml_home_dir/members-mailmag.
$ml_home_dir/members is not used.
Hence, recipients is updated but the list of posters is unchanged.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
Strictly speaking, this configuration is not enough safe.  If somebody
fakes From: address, he/she can post since fml checks only From:
address.
