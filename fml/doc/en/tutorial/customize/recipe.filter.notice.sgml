</para>
</question>

<answer>

<para>
By default, It is defined as
<screen>
use_article_filter_reject_notice	=	yes
article_filter_reject_notice_recipient	=	maintainer sender
</screen>
When the filter system rejects the request,
fml sends back it to both the ML maintainer and the sender.
</para>


<para>
To change the recipient to the sender (From: address) only, set
<screen>
article_filter_reject_notice_recipient	=	sender
</screen>
</para>


<para>
To notify the rejection to both ML maintainer and the sender, set
<screen>
article_filter_reject_notice_recipient	=	maintainer sender
</screen>
</para>


<para>
To disable notification of rejection, set 
<screen>
use_article_filter_reject_notice	=	no
</screen>
</para>
