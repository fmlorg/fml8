<warning>
<para>
&fmldevel; already implemented fundamental functions
except for configuration editing.
Several people uses &fmldevel; as operational level.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; is intended to implement almost all &fml4; functions but
not yet.
So, if you are interested in the use of special features, 
please use

	The road to the next generation of fml
	</title>

<para>
&fmldevel; is fully rewritten mailing list driver from scratch to
re-implement &fml4; The purpose of this project is re-implementation
of fml mailing list driver system, based on my 10 years experience.
</para>

<para>
Roughly speaking, the relatoin between &fml4; and &fmldevel; is
similar to one between sendmail and postfix.
</para>

<para>
&fmldevel; re-implements features of &fml4; functions.  We redesing
fml and clean up the function and variable naming convenstion.
</para>

<para>
For example, when you use &fml4;, you'll find that fml supposes list
of members is found in the text file on the host.  &fml4; inherits the
assumption through from version 1.0. It affetcts the core part of
designs. Hence, it is difficult to extend fml IO for the use of RDBMS,
redundency et.al. We should need to fully rewrite fml core parts.
</para>

<para>
Also, I need a lot of new features. &fmldevel; should provide tiny bug
tracking system maintatined automatically. 
It is better to co-relate fml with cvs log.
</para>

<para>
Firstly, we need to discuss what we inherit from fml 4.0 design and
features.

    <itemizedlist>


    <listitem>
	<para>
	What we inherit into &fmldevel; from &fml4; ?
	</para>
    </listitem>


    <listitem>
	<para>
	easily customisable ?
	</para>
    </listitem>


    <listitem>
	<para>
	remove obsolete features.
	</para>
    </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

Anyway, we should write code for the further discussion!

We implement new feature at &fml8; branch.
&fml4; imports it if needed.
We only have to bug-fix at &fml4; branch.
