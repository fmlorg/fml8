	virtual domain handling
	</title>

<para>
It is difficult to handle virtual domains and the default domain in
same ways.
</para>

<para>
We user "user@domain" form for the ML name if it is an ML of a virtual
domain. For example, for a virtual domain, use makefml like this
<screen>
% makefml newml mlname@virtualdomain
</screen>
but both syntaxes are ok for the default domain.
<screen>
% makefml newml mlname@defaultdomain
% makefml newml mlname
</screen>
fml treats these properly as could as possible but fml needs some
hints such as the ml home directory information.
You need to prepare /usr/local/etc/fml/virtual file for a hint on
domain to directory mappings.
This file name is $virtual_maps in main.cf.
</para>

<para>
It is easy. Prepare
<link linkend="install.virtual">
/etc/fml/virtual
</link>
file. 
After that, use "user@domain" form in makefml for virtual domains.
<screen>
makefml newml	ML@virtualdomain
makefml add	ML@virtualdomain	address
makefml bye	ML@virtualdomain	address
</screen>
Instead, for the default domain, either of user and user@domain is
accpetable.
</para>

<para>
When you use CGI, you need not to use user@domain syntax 
since the url of config.cgi includes the domain name.
<screen>
http://lists/~fml/cgi-bin/fml/$domain/admin/config.cgi
</screen>
</para>

<warning>
<para>
The domain name is hard-coded within config.cgi.  makefml inject the
domain name in creating config.cgi when "makefml newml" runs.
config.cgi does not resolve its domain by URL.
</para>
