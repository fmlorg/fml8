	<title>
	Case 1: /var/spool/ml/elena/ from &fml4; to &fml8;
	</title>

<para>
This conversion does the following steps in fact.
</para>

<para>
1) install &fml8; firstly. In this case, add
/var/spool/ml/etc/mail/aliases into $alias_maps of postfix main.cf.
/var/spool/ml/etc/mail/aliases may be empty.
</para>

<para>
2) run "makefml --force newml elena" to create several files &fml8;
needs.
</para>

<para>
3) convert address lists in /var/spool/ml/elena to &fml8; style.
</para>

<para>
3-1)
IO::Adapter ignores a line beginning with '^#' as a comment.
We should handle carefully it since
"actives" file contains ^# lines as "off" address.
</para>

<para>
3-2)
s=skip (off) options is ignored. 
It handles as "on".
</para>

<para>
3-3)
m=... (digest) options is ignored.

Also, "# address" is "off" in the case of &fml4; but ignored in the
case of &fml8;. We should warn it ?
</para>

<para>
4) remove the corresponding entry of alias file
(/var/spool/ml/etc/fml/aliases) of &fml4; and rebuild .db. 
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2>
	<title>
	Case 2: convert the whole /var/spool/ml/ from &fml4; to &fml8;
	</title>

<para>
Apply case 1 for all ML's.
</para>

<para>
If we can stop all ML's, it is easy to remove
/var/spool/ml/etc/fml/aliases of &fml4; firstly and apply case 1 steps.
stop MTA in migration.
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2>
	<title>
	Discussion: use half and half of &fml4; and &fml8; softwares.
	</title>

<para>
(X-Sequence: fml-devel 389)
</para>

<para>
How in half and half case.
</para>

<para>
For example, site_init.ph or config.ph of &fml4; follows
<screen>
[fml4]

push(@ACTIVE_LIST,"$DIR/recipients") if( -f "$DIR/recipients" ) ;
</screen>
instead in the case of &fml8;
site_default_config.cf or config.cf follows: 
<screen>
[fml8]

html_archive_dir = $ml_home_dir/htdocs
</screen>
</para>
