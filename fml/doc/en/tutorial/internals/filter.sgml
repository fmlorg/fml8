<chapter id="internals.filter">

	Filter
	</title>

<caution>

<para>
Filter described here is filter system for articles posted to ML.
This filter is implemented as FML::Filter class.
</para>

<para>
Other than article filter, there may be command mail filter.
FML::Filter does not provide such function. Instead, 
FML::Command::Filter class provides command mail specific filter
e.g. line length limit of one line.
</para>

</caution>


<sect1  id="internals.filter.overview">
	<title>
	Overview of filter system
	</title>

<para>
There are three types of filter system for content check such as for
header, body and mime structure based.  Other than the tree cases, we
should consider text/plain and non mime text (text/?) filter. So there
may be four types of filter.
<screen>

  header

  body
	non-mime
		permit / reject (!MIME of 4.0's content filter)

	mime component filter
		4.0's content filter

	text/plain filter
			ja, en, ... (language dependent)
			language independent (e.g. M$ GUID scanner)
		check of the first text/plain part
		syntax check

	external filter (call external virus/spam checker)
		clamav
		spamassassin
		bogofilter
</screen>
Other than these filters, content_filter using SMTP/LMTP can be needed
but not implemented. If you need content_filter, please use the
function of postfix.
</para>

<!-- XXX-TODO traffic filter -->
<para>
Traffic based filter is also needed but not implemented yet.
</para>

<sect1 id="internals.filter.config">

<para>
Each sub filter system is enabled/disabled independently.
</para>

<para>
<screen>
use_SERVICE_filter       = yes
SERVICE_filter_functions = function_A function_B

use_function_A           = yes
function_A_rules         = rule_01 urle_02

</para>

&var.filter.rules;

<sect1 id="internals.filter.size">
	<title>
	Size limit
	</title>

<para>
&fml8; provides size limit for header and body.
Also you can use different size limit of article or command mail.
</para>

<para>
Implementation of this filter is easy since
the input message is analyzed already.
</para>

&var.filter.size;

</sect1>


<sect1 id="internals.filter.command">
	<title>
	limit for command mail
	</title>

<para>
&fml8; provides restrictions such as 
"the number of commands in one command mail message",
"the number of articles in one command mail message", et.al.
</para>

<!-- &table.list.filter.commandmail; -->

</sect1>


<sect1 id="internals.filter.mimecomponent">
	<title>
	mime component filter rules
	</title>

<para>
The format of &fml8; mime component filter is space separeted.
It is not &fml4;'s content filter rules. 
<screen>
text/plain 	permit
text/html	reject
*		permit
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This filter supporse MIME, not including non mime operations.  To
identify the whole type (e.g. text/plain) and the part type
(e.g. text/plain in multipart/mixed), we use the following format.
<screen>
Whole message type      part type      action
----------------------------------------------
text/plain 		*		permit
multipart/mixed		text/plain	permit
multipart/mixed		text/html	reject
multipart/mixed		image/*		cutoff
*			*		permit
</screen>
the following operations are not implemented but needed ?
<screen>
text/plain 		:uuencoded:	cutoff
text/plain 		:size>500k	cutoff
</screen>
</para>

<para>
But there are several problems of rule construction.
</para>

<sect2>
	<title>
	first match vs last match ?
	</title>

<para>
This is a filter but not a router filter.  Router filter is first
match almost cases.  But both first match and last match are not
suitable for mime component filter when we consider the meaning of
"cutoff" operation.
</para>
