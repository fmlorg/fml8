	<title>
	Errormail Analyzer (libexec/error)
	</title>

<para>
&fml8; error (/usr/local/libexec/fml/error) program corresponds to
mead (/usr/local/fml/libexec/mead) of &fml4;
</para>

<para>
set "$use_error_mail_analyzer_function = yes" to enable error mail
analyzer function. By default, $use_error_mail_analyzer_function is
yes. That is, &fml8; error analyzer is enabled by default but &fml4;
not. This default behaviour differs from &fml4;.
</para>

<para>
In fact, typical functions of &fml8; are enabled by default.
</para>

	Overview
	</title>

<para>
&fml8; sets up that $ml-admin address (address error messages returned
to) calls /usr/local/libexec/fml/error in creating a ML.
</para>

<para>
/usr/local/libexec/fml/error reads a message, analyzes it and creates
a chain of Mail::Message objects on memory. Mail::Bounce class
analyzes the detail of error based on the object.
</para>

<para>
Mail::Bounce analylzes which MTA generates the error, which address
generates the error, and the error reason.
</para>

<para>
The result is cached at $error_mail_analyzer_cache_dir directory.
</para>

<para>
After some time interval, $error_mail_analyzer_function analyzes the
cache data to determine if an address is effective or not. If some
address is determined to be removed, &fml8; removes it from
member/recipient list.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="error.internal.algorithm">
	<title>
	Algorithm of error detection
	</title>

<para>
Functions of $error_mail_analyzer_function_select_list are available
to determine error or not. Currently "simple_count histgram" and
"histgram" algorithm are supported. "histgram" is used by default.
</para>


<sect2>
	<title>
	Algorithm: simple_count
	</title>

<para>
Count up the number of error messages from an address and
determine whether the address is effective or not.
</para>

<para>
This logic depends on just the total number of errors.  If the traffic
of ML is high, little configuration error of recipients caueses
removal of the address soon.
This is the main problem of this logic.
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2>
	<title>
	Algorithm: histgram
	</title>

<para>
Count up the number of continuous days that error messages returned.
If the number oversomes the threshold, &fml8; removes the
corresponding address. The threshold is 14 days by default.
</para>

<para>
This logic assumes that the traffic of a ML is at least one message
per day. In other words, this logic requires the continuous error. So,
little configuration error in the side of recipient has no effect.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; uses this algorithm by default.
</para>

<para>
Caution: If the traffic of the ML is too little under at least one
message per day, this algorithm does not work.
</para>

<sect1 id="error.internal.cache">
	<title>
	Cache of error messages data
	</title>

<para>
Error messages data is cached at $error_mail_analyzer_cache_dir
directory.
</para>

<para>
IO to cache uses Tie::JournaledDir class via FML::Error::Cache. 
</para>

<para>
FML::Error::Cache is a front end (adapter layer) for Tie::JournaledDir
class. All IO should be done via methods provided by FML::Error::Cache.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1 id="error.internal.message.forward">
	<title>
	Forward error messages
	</title>

<para>
You can specify the location the error message is forwarded to as
$maintainer_recipient_maps
variable.
Undefiend by default.
Error messages are logged at a log file but not forwarded.
</para>

<para>
If enabled, this function forwards the error messages. Just forward it
as mime/multipart which contains one messages/rfc822 part.
</para>

<para>
FUTURE PLAN: we forward error messages with the analyzed data.
</para>
