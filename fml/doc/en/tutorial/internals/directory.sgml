	Q: how recursively sub directory can be created ?

<para>
The structore holding the html-ized article is as follows:
<screen>
200201/msg\d+.html
</screen>
</para>

<para>
one sub-directory by default.
</para>

<para>
Consider directory listing.
"ls" returns 1000 files soon, but 10000 files a little slowly.
</para>

<para>
To accelerate listing, we should use sub-directory structure.
For example, each sub-directory holds 1000 files.
The structure such as "spool/sub/file" holds 10^6 ( million ) files 
and
listing of it is fast.
</para>

<para>
It must be enough to assume that 1 million articles for one ML.
