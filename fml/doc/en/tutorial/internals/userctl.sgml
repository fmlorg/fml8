	Which Map Subscribe/Unsubscribe Is Operated To ?
	</title>

<para>
Subscribe/unsubscribe is operated to $primary_*_map.
</para>

<para>
For example, 
subscription of remote administrators is operated into
both $primary_admin_member_map and $primary_admin_recipient_map.
Unsubscription of remote administrators is operated into
both $primary_admin_member_map and $primary_admin_recipient_map.
</para>

<para>
Why use primary_*_map ?
If we use admin_member_maps and admin_recipient_maps, it causes a problem.
</para>

<para>
Subscription should be operated into one map. So we should operate it
into primary_*_map.
</para>

<para>
Unsubscription must be same since xxx_maps is composed of different
privileged maps.
</para>

<para>
For example, $member_maps is as follows.
It contais a list of member and a list of remote administrators.
<screen>
member_maps		=	$primary_member_map
				$admin_member_maps
</screen>
So unsubscription operated for $member_maps may cause 
unsubscription of remote administrators. It is wrong logic.
