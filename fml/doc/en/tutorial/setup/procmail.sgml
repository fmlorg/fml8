	I want to use ML by my account.

<para>
When you set up a ML within your account, for example when you are
using virtual domain service of ISP, you need to use a mail processor
such as procmail.
</para>

<para>
To catch up messages to ML's, you need to filter messages according to
To: or Cc: in the mail header and redistribute it.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; expects the user uses a filter tool such as procmail in such a
situation. &fml8; itself does not provide such a tool.
</para>

<para>
makefml creates/updates ~/.procmailrc sample in running "makefml
newml" at /var/spool/ml/etc/procmail/procmailrc. Please use it as a
sample.

	virtual domain case

<para>
The procmail rules above contains ml_name and ml_domain within it.
So it does not need special handling for virtual domain.
</para>

<para>
MTA configuration is another issue. Please contact administrator on
it.
