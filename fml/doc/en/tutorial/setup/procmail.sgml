	I Want To Use ML By My Account.
	</title>

<para>
When you set up an ML within your account, for example when you are
using virtual domain service of ISP, you need to use a mail processor
such as procmail.
</para>

<para>
To catch up messages to ML's, you need to filter messages according to
To: or Cc: in the mail header.
</para>

<para>
&fml8; expects the user uses a filter tool such as procmail in such a
situation. &fml8; distribution itself does not provide such a tool.
</para>

<para>
When running "makefml newml", "makefml" creates/updates ~/.procmailrc
sample at /var/spool/ml/etc/procmail/procmailrc. Please use it as a
sample.
</para>

	Virtual Domain Case
	</title>

<para>
The procmail rules above contains ml_name and ml_domain within it.
So it does not need special handling for virtual domain.
It is same for both default domain and virtual domain.
</para>

<para>
MTA configuration is another issue. Please contact administrator on
it.
