<para>
In running "makefml newml", makefml sets up
configuration files such as config.cf,
include files for sendmail and postfix and
~fml/.qmail-* files. 
<screen>
% su fml
% makefml newml elena
   ... snip ...
% ls /var/spool/ml/elena
config.cf include include-ctl include-error
	... snip ...
</screen>
</para>

<para>
To customize one ML configuraiton,
edit config.cf.

<para>
config.cf contains little definition.
For example,
/var/spool/ml/elena/include file follows:
<screen>
"| /usr/local/libexec/fml/distribute elena@fml.org"
</screen>
/var/spool/ml/elena/include-ctl file follows:
<screen>
"| /usr/local/libexec/fml/commande elena@fml.org"
</screen>
/usr/local/libexec/fml/PROGMAR resolves ml_name and ml_domain from 
the arguments such as elena@fml.org.
That is, elena@fml.org in this argument determines 
values of $ml_domain and $ml_name.
It is enough that ml_name and ml_domain in config.cf is a comment.
</para>

<para>
The content of include, include-ctl and aliases are same as &fml4;
except for the path.
