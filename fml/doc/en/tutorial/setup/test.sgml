<sect1>
	<title>
	Before Test
	</title>

<warning>
<para>
Set up MTA properly before test of fml.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
In this chapter,
&fmldevel; and MTA works on ahodori.fml.org, which is called as 
the mail server.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
	<title>
	Test Of MTA
	</title>

<para>
Firstly, check MTA without fml on ahodori.fml.org.
</para>

<para>
Prepare one personal user address such as rudo@fml.org.
Usually, just create a user named as "rudo".
<screen>
# useradd rudo
</screen>
Check you can send a mail to rudo@fml.org on ahodori.fml.org and rudo
receives the mail.
<screen>
% echo test |Mail rudo@fml.org
</screen>
If it not works, check MTA configuration.
See /var/log/maillog et.al to track errors.
</para>

<para>
Secondary, verify mail delivery over network.
Send a mail to rudo@fml.org from other host (not ahodori.fml.org).
If rudo receives the mail, MTA is o.k.
</para>

<para>
If both work well, MTA configuration must be ok.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
	<title>
	Send A Mail To ML
	</title>

<para>
Create elena ML (elena@fml.org) and subscribe rudo@fml.org to elena ML.
<screen>
% su fml
% makefml newml elena
% makefml add elena rudo@fml.org
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Send a test mail to elena@fml.org from on the host and from other host
(not ahodori.fml.org).  Verify the header of this test mail should be
"From: rudo@fml.org" since &fml8; checks the From: header field.
</para>


<sect2>
	<title>
	Checkpoints
	</title>

<para>
If something not work well, check the following points: 
<screen>
check the mail server log (e.g. /var/log/maillog)
check the fml log (e.g. /var/spool/m/elena/log)
fml can pass the message to MTA ? (e.g. /var/spool/m/elena/log)
MTA succeeds to deliver it? (e.g. /var/log/maillog)
</screen>
</para>

</sect2>

<sect1>
	<title>
	Test Of &fml8; Itself.
	</title>

<para>
*** not yet implemented ***.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1>
	<title>
	Reset After Test.
	</title>

<para>
It is easy to re-create this mailing list (e.g. test ML).
<screen>
% su fml
% makefml rmml test
% makefml newml test
</screen>
The removed ML home is left as /var/spool/ml/@test.$DATE.$SEQUENCE.
Please remove it since this is a test to avoid the duplication in the
future.
<screen>
% rm -fr /var/spool/ml/@test.$DATE.*
</screen>
