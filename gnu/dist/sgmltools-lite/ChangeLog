        * Several updates to begin moving sgmltools-lite into the LSB world.

2001-04-21  David Nedrow <dnedrow@usa.net>

        * Updated primary spec file for RedHat 7.1

        * Renamed sgmltools.1 manpage to sgmltools-lite.1 to avoid conflicts
          with sgmltools version 1 manpage.

	* Added new w3m backend  
	  (http://ei5nazha.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~aito/w3m/eng/)

	* Slight change to txt backend. If w3m is installed it is used rather
	  than Lynx.

	* Added support to Makefile.in for building RPMs (see README.rpm).

	* Structural change to allow building RPM's directly from the source
	  file (rpm -ta sgmltools-lite-<ver>.tar.gz).

	* Oh, and I bumped up the version number for the whole project
	to 3.0.2

	* VERSION is now created by the Makefile instead of being distributed

	* make install now installs the distributed catalogues as well

	* Updated dist: target

	* "Imported" .spec file (for building RPM packages)
	(SourceForge does not allow real import, just added the latest
	version)
	Updated the .spec file to match the current version of the CVS tree.

	* Added catalogue files for SuSE (containing cdegroot's setup)
	and Red Hat.

	* Modified POSTINSTALL to include instructions and package names
	for Red Hat as well.

2000-06-26  Marc André Selig  <mas@seligma.com>

	* Added a target "dist" to Makefile.in that will create a
	distributable tarball.
