SGMLtools-Lite post installation instructions
---------------------------------------------

SGMLtools-Lite needs a bunch of SGML-related data files in order to function
correctly. These data files may already be on your system, or be part
of your Linux distribution, because lots of Linux distributors now bundle
them. The package names for SuSE and RedHat are included in this document;
if you have a set of package names for your distribution, I'll be happy to
add them.

Here are the packages you need to have installed:

* SGML ISO 8879:1986 entity declarations

  This is a set of declarations for standard character entities.

  RedHat: sgml-common (RH 6.2 uses sgml-common-0.1-8.noarch.rpm)
  SuSE:   sgm1/iso_ent.rpm

* DocBook 3.1 Document Type Definition

  This is the actual DocBook DTD.

  RedHat 6.2: docbook
  RedHat 7.1: docbook-dtd31-sgml
  SuSE:   sgm1/docbk31.rpm

* DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets

  This are the stylesheets that Jade uses to transform SGML into 
  whatever backend format you like.

  RedHat 6.2: stylesheets
  RedHat 7.1: docbook-style-dsssl
  SuSE:   sgm1/docbkdsl.rpm

Each of these packages, and Jade and SGMLtools-Lite as well, have a 
catalog that points to other files in the packages. If you don't 
know about SGML catalog files, don't worry: you won't need to know. 

What you should make sure is that you have the names of the following 
catalog files strung together in the environment variable SGML_CATALOG_FILES
(don't forget to export it!):

- DocBook DTD catalog: "docbook.cat" in the DocBook DTD directory
- DocBook DSSL catalog: "catalog" in the DocBook DSSSL stylesheets directory
- ISO Entities catalog: "iso-entities.cat" in the ISO 8870:1986 directory
- Jade catalog: "dsssl.cat" in the Jade data directory
- SGMLtools DTD catalog: "catalog" in the SGMLtools DTD directory
- SGMLtools DSSSL catalog: "sgmltools.cat" in the SGMLtools DSSSL directory

Here is cdegroot's version for SuSE Linux:
% echo $SGML_CATALOG_FILES
/usr/local/share/sgml/stylesheets/docbook/catalog:/usr/local/share/sgml/entities/iso-entities-8879.1986/iso-entities.cat:/usr/local/share/sgml/dtd/jade/dsssl.cat:/usr/local/share/sgml/stylesheets/sgmltools/sgmltools.cat:/usr/local/share/sgml/dtd/sgmltools/catalog:/usr/local/share/sgml/dtd/docbook/3.1/docbook.cat

If yours looks similar, you have a working catalog setup.

    Tip: there's a little program called 'gensgmlenv' that is installed
    with the SGMLtools distribution. If you collect a bunch of symlinks
    in to all these catalog files mentioned above in /etc/sgml/catalog.d,
    running this script will generate a Bourne-shell and a C-shell file
    in /etc/sgml that defines the SGML_CATALOG_FILES variable.

    Tip: The current developer version of sgmltools-lite contains
    master catalogue files for RedHat and SuSE.  You can just place
    these files somewhere convenient and then point SGML_CATALOG_FILES
    to this master catalog.

The second thing you need to have working is JadeTeX. JadeTeX itself is not
hard to install:

    RedHat: jadetex (RH 6.2 uses jadetex-2.7-2.i386.rpm)
    SuSE:   sgm1/jadetex.rpm

JadeTeX eats enourmous amounts of TeX memory and needs special TeX
configuration.  The SuSE RPMs take care of that, but if your distribution
does not, or if you need to install JadeTeX manually, tune texmf.cnf
and set the following parameters:

    hash_extra.jadetex = 15000
    pool_size.jadetex = 200000
    max_strings.jadetex = 50000
    save_size.jadetex = 15000

If you're unsure, don't touch the file and start working with SGMLtools-Lite.
When you get a TeX error message complaining about capacities, you'll know
what to do...

That's all, folks!
