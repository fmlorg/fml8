.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sgmltools
[\-b backend] [\-d] [\-v] [\-V] [\-h] [\-l] [\-s dsssl_spec] [\-j jadeopt]
[\-\-backend={html,ps,dvi,rtf,txt,ld2db,jadetex,pdb,lynx,w3m}] [\-\-debug] 
[\-\-verbose] 
[\-\-dsssl\-spec=dsssl_spec] [\-\-jade\-opt=jadeopt]
[\-\-version] [\-\-help] [\-\-license]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sgmltools
is the central driver of SGMLtools. You can use it to convert SGML input
files to various formats, as indicated by the 
.I \-\-backend
switch.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-b, \-\-backend"
Select the backend to use. Currently, there are five different backends to
choose from. 
.B ps
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into PostScript.
.B dvi
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into DVI.
.B rtf
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into RTF.
.B html
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into HTML; the resulting
files will be put in a subdirectory (default).
.B txt
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into ASCII. Note that this
backend actually uses the w3m (preferred) or lynx (if w3m not found) backends.
.B ld2db
expects a LinuxDoc-SGML file and will convert it into DocBook SGML.
.B jadetex
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into JadeTeX input. Only
use this if you know what you're doing.
.B pdb
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into the iSilo format used
on Palm devices.
.B w3m
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into ASCII. w3m does a better
job of exporting HTML as ASCII text than Lynx, since w3m understands tables.
One should normally use the txt backend and let sgmltools decide which ASCII 
exporter is available.
.B lynx
expects a DocBook SGML file and will convert it into ASCII. One should normally
use the txt backend and let sgmltools decide which ASCII exporter is available.
.TP
.I "\-d, \-\-debug"
Enable debugging. All temporary files will be left as is and possibly extra
information on the processing steps is printed to stderr.
.TP
.I "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Be verbose. Information on commands executed, etcetera, will be printed to
stdout.
.TP
.I "\-s, \-\-dsssl-spec"
Specify the DSSSL stylesheet to apply (see STYLESHEETS, below).
.TP
.I "\-j, \-\-jade-opt"
Pass additional options directly to Jade.
.TP
.I "\-h, \-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully (tbd).
.TP
.I "\-V, \-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully (tbd).
.TP
.I "\-l, \-\-license"
Print license information
.SH STYLESHEETS
The DSSSL specification may be either a filename, a public identifier or
a DSSSL alias (resolved via one of the alias files
.B /etc/sgml/aliases
and
.B ~/.sgmlaliases
to either a filename or a public identifier).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B TMPDIR
Temporary directory. If it is on a local filesystem, a lot of copying will
be avoided. Furthermore, setting this will prevent SGMLtools from using
/tmp and thus will prevent people trying to make use of race conditions.
.TP
.B SGML_CATALOG_FILES
The SGML Open catalog files to use for resolving public identifiers into
system identifiers.
.SH BUGS
This is an early developer release, so don't expect it to behave in any
useful way. It won't make coffee or tea.
