NAME

    buildcat - build a shared catalog file.

SYNOPSIS

    # buildcat >/etc/sgml/catalog

DESCRIPTION

    The program **buildcat** builds a shared catalog file from
    the symlinks encountered in /etc/sgml. In order to
    keep the meaning of the individual catalogs the same, relative
    system identifiers in the catalogs are expanded to their absolute
    equivalents.
