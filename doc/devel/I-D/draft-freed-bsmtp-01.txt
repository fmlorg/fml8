This document defines a MIME content type suitable for tunneling an
ESMTP [RFC-821, RFC-1869] transaction through any MIME-capable
transport.  This type can be used for a variety of purposes,
including: Extending end-to-end MIME-based security services (e.g.,
[RFC-1847]) to cover message envelope information as well as message
content.  Making it possible to use specific SMTP extensions such as
NOTARY [RFC-1891] over unextended SMTP transport infrastructure.
Enabling the transfer of multiple separate messages in a single
transactional unit.
