        RFC 2346:

        Title:      Making Postscript and PDF International
	Author(s):  J. Palme
	Status:     Informational
	Date:       May 1998
        Mailbox:    jpalme@dsv.su.se
   	Pages:      6
        Characters: 12382
        Updates/Obsoletes: None

Certain text formats, for example Postscript (MIME-Type:
application/postscript; file extension .ps) and Portable Document
Format (MIME-Type: application/pdf; file extension .pdf) specify
exactly the page layout of the printed document. The commonly used
paper format is different in North America and the rest of the world.
North America uses the \'Letter' format, while the rest of the world
mostly uses the ISO-standard \'A4' format. This means that documents
formatted on one continent may not be easily printable on another
continent. This memo gives advice on how to produce documents which
are equally well printable with the Letter and the A4 formats. By
using the advice in this document, you can put up a document on the
Internet, which recipients can print without problem both in and
outside North America.

This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
be sent to RFC-DIST-REQUEST@ISI.EDU.
