1.1   Abstract

This memo specifies extensions to e-mail and netnews standards, to
allow for the submission of translations of messages, not only at
initial submission time, but also at later time, and made by other
translators than the original author of the message. three new e-
mail/netnews header fields are proposed, "Content-Translation-Of,
"Content-Translator" and "Translation-Request".

Appendix 1: An Investigation of Handling of
Multipart/Alternative in some Common Mailers in November 2000


2     Language Support in Existing Standards

The "Content-Language:" e-mail content header specified in RFC 1766 [6]
can be used to specify one or a list of natural languages used in that
message body.

The "Content-Type: Multipart/alternative" defined in MIME [4] might be
used to send the same text in more than one language. Each part would
then be marked with the "Content-Language:" header to indicate its
language, and the recipient might choose the body part according to his
or her language preferences. The combination of Multipart/alternative
with Content-Language is however not commonly supported and gives
disastrous results with most mailers (November 2000), so this solution
is not recommended in this specification.

In HTTP [7], a request operation can indicate a list of preferred
languages, and the server can then deliver the resource in the
preferred language. The request operation can also indicate how good
each language is for a particular user, in the format:

          Accept-Content-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7

HTTP also has facilities for the server to tell the client which
alternatives are available in different languages, letting the client
choose between them. It is also possible, with HTTP, to deliver a
resource in the "Multipart/alternative" format, if the recipient wants
to store the resource in all available language versions. These HTTP
features are however not commonly supported (November 2000).

All of these methods of transmitting information is based on the
assumption that all language versions are ready and available when a
message is sent.


3     Multi-Language Scenario

John Smith writes a message in English and submits it to a mailing list
or to a Usenet newsgroup. The mailing list expander sends this message
to an automatic translation agent which translates it into other
languages and returns the translations to the mailing list expander.
The mailing list expander might then either forward all translations to
each member of the list, or forward to each member only the translation
preferred by this member. Ernst D’rrenmatt has requested the mailing
list to send him all language versions, but reads this message in
English, because he has indicated that he prefers English original
documents to automatic German translations. Hilda Schmidt reads the
message in both English and German, decides that the automatic German
translation is not very good, and cleans it up, submitting a new better
translation to German. Ernst D’rrenmatt checks this translation, makes
some corrections, and submits a final corrected version of the German
translation of the original message.


4     The Content-Translation-Of Header Field

The "Content-Translation-Of" header field is used when submitting a
translation to a message, which earlier has been sent in another
language. The syntax for this header field is similar to the syntax for
the "In-Reply-To" header, but only one value is allowed, since every
translation can only be the translation of one previous message. The
value contains the Message-ID of the original message before
translation. If a message is available in more than one language,
"Content-Translation-Of" should always reference the original message,
even if the translation was actually based on a translated version. If
the original message is available in more than one version, with
"Supersedes" or "Replaces" references between the versions, then the
"Content-Translation-Of" should reference the version which was the
basis of this translation.

Translation is applied to the body content, and to the content of the
"Subject:" header, but not to any other header contents. When a
"Subject:" is translated, the language code enclosed in parenthesis"
can be added to the beginning of the "Subject".

If more than one translation is available of the same original message,
the "Supersedes" or "Replaces" header field should not be used between
them. "Supersedes" or "Replaces" are only to be used when the original
message is revised.


5     The Content-Translator Header Field

The "Content-Translator" header field indicates who made the
translation. When a translation is submitted, the "From" header field
should still indicate the original author, but the "Content-Translator"
header field can indicate who made the translation.

The syntax of the "Content-Translator" header field is:

Content-Translator           = "Content-Translator:" ( CFWS mailbox-
list / Phrase )
                       *(";" translator-parameter) CFWS CRLF

translator-parameter = art / fluency / future-extension

art                  = "Human" / "Machine" / "Original"

fluency              = "Expert" / "Native" / "Other"

The meaning of these parameters are:

Human    = Translation was made or revised/approved by a human
           translator.

Machine  = Translation was entirely automatic, with no human checking
           of the translation. In this case, the "Auto-Submitted" [8]
           header should also be added to the message heading.

Original = This is the original before translation. Absence of a
           "Content-Translator" also indicates that the message is not
           translated, but "Content-Translator: None; Original" can be
           used to explicitly specify that this is not translated.

Expert   = Translation was made by an expert translator.

Native   = Translation was made by a native speaker of the target
           language.


Other    = Translation was made by someone who is not an expert nor
           a native speaker of the target language.


6     USE of The Multipart/Choices MIME Content Type

When several translations of the same message are sent in the same
message, the content-type multipart/choices, as defined in [9].

If translation is desired also of the "Subject" header, then the
translated body parts have to be of content-type Message/rfc822, since
only that content-type allows different subject in different body
parts.

It is recommended to add information about translation at the top of
each body part (example, see section 8.3 below), because some mailers
display multiple body parts in sequence inline with no indication of
the Differences between them. This recommendation may be lifted at some
future time when most mailers have support for Multipart/choices.

It is also recommended to add a blank line at the end of each
translation, since this will show up neater on some old mailers, which
display all body parts in sequence to the recipient.


7     The Translation-Request Header

The Translation-Request header is used when sending a message for
translation to a human or machine translator. Its value is a list of
the languages to which translation is requested. The languages are
specified according to [6]. The language of the original can be
included in the Translation-Request header, this tells the translator
to include the original of the message when it is forwarded after
translation, together with the translations to other languages.

When the Translation-Request header is used, the content-type should
always be "Message/rfc822" [5] and the content should be the message to
be translated. When the translation is ready, the translator is
instructed to send the translation to the recipients in the "To:",
"Cc:" and "Bcc:" headers and to leave non-translated headers of the
message/rfc822 body as they were before the translation. When the
translator resends the translation, Resent-From" is added with the name
of the translator, and "Resent-Date" with the date of the translation.
If translation to multiple languages is requested, the result is sent
using the content-type multipart/choices.

Syntax: "Translation-Request:" CFWS language 1*(, CFWS language)
        CFWS CRLF

9     For Further Study

The following is not yet resolved in this draft:

-  How a user can register its language preferences with a mail
   server or a mailing list expander.

-  Whether POP/IMAP should be extended with commands to request
   messages in only a certain language.

-  How to handle translation in Usenet News. One might for example
   have a set of co-ordinated newsgroups, with the same articles in
   different languages. A newsgroup "alt.cultures.multiple" might be
   provided with English in "alt.cultures.multiple.en", German in
   "alt.cultures.multiple.de", etc., with automatic or manual
   translation of the messages between these newsgroups.

-  Handling of signatures and seals.


10    Security Considerations

Translations made by other people than the original author of
a message will of course entail the risk of intentional or
unintentional incorrectness of the translation. But this is a
risk we must accept if we want to have translations, and if
everyone is not fluent in every language.

Some people claim that machine translation technology is so
bad, that it should not be used at all. I do not agree,
machine translation will often give a good understanding of
the intent of the original text even if the translation is not
perfect. And if the recipient has a choice of either not
understanding a message at all, or getting a machine
translation, the recipient may still prefer the automatic
translation. Based on this, the recipient might decide whether
the message is of enough interest to be willing to pay for a
human to make a better translation.

The risk can be reduced, if the receiving user agent clearly
shows that a message is a translator, who made the
translation, and allows the user to check the original text
and compare it with the translation.

A translation will invalidate any digital signatures or seals,
but the translator might add its own signature and seals to
ensure that the translation is not corrupted when sent from
translator to readers. These signatures and seals will not
promise any correspondence with the original text, except the
promise which a translator might give of the correctness of
its translations.

Appendix 1: An Investigation of Handling of Multipart/Alternative in
some Common Mailers in November 2000

As a basis for possible work on developing standards for language-
translation in e-mail, I tested how some common mailers handled
multipart/alternative with different Content-Language in the body parts
in November 2000.

I used the following test messages:

Test message 1: First part English, second part German

Test message 2: Same as test message 1, but first part German, second
part English

Test message 3: Same as test message 2, but multipart/mixed instead of
multipart/alternative.

Test message 4: Same as test message 3, but with Content-Disposition:
Attachment on all but the first body part.

Test message 5: Multipart/mixed on an outer level, with the first part
a directory of attachments, and the second part a multipart/alternative
with the German and English parts as the two alternatives.

Test message 6: Multipart/alternative with the first part containing
all the translations in one body part, and the second part a
multipart/alternative with one translation in each alternative.

I tested this with the following mailers:
Eudora 5 Macintosh, Pine 4.21 on Unix, Netscape 4.7 Macintosh, Outlook
Express 5 Macintosh, First Class 5.611 Macintosh, KOM 2000 (our own
system), and Hotmail.

Result: None of the mailers seemed to test on the Content-Language
value, and make a selection based on this.

Eudora, Outlook Express, KOM 2000 and Hotmail only showed the first
body part. Netscape only showed the second body part. Pine only showed
the second body part, but provided a user command to see also the first
body part. First Class displayed both body parts in sequence, i.e. i
treated multipart/alternative as identical to multipart/mixed.

The conclusion of this is that if IETF makes a standard, specifying
that different translations of the same message should be sent with
multipart/alternative with different Content-Language on the different
body parts, then most mailers will not show a user the version in the
preferred language of that user.

Since backwards compatibility with existing mailers is very important,
this seems to indicate that an IETF standard for handling of language
translation in e-mail has to use some other format than
multipart/alternative to indicate translations.

I also tested some more complex messages. In test message 4, I used
multipart/mixed with three body parts, the first a list of the rest of
the body parts, which contained the message in different languages.
This format was not ideal either with the existing mailers. Most of
them showed all three body parts in sequence inline (even though all
except the first were marked as Content-Disposition: Attachment) and
some of them without any visible marker between the body parts.

In test message 5, on the top level is a multipart/mixed with two body
parts, the first a list of the body parts, the second a
multipart/alternative with the different language parts. This had the
same problem as all the other multipart/alternative test examples: Many
of the mailers arbitrarily chooses one of the multipart/alternatives
and only shows this, some mailers choose the first alternative, some
the second.

In test message 6, I had on the top level a multipart/alternative where
the first body part was a text/plain with all the language versions in
one text. The second body part was another multipart/alternative with
the different language parts as body parts. A mailer which cannot
discriminate between languages, should for this message only display
body part 1. Only Outlook Express and KOM 2000 did this. Pine, Netscape
and Hotmail arbitrarily showed only one language version.

In test message 7, I tested the format proposed in this ietf-draft, as
shown in section 8.3 above.
