   2. Introduction 
    
   This document describes a mechanism to allow senders of a multi-part 
   Internet mail message to convey presentational information of the 
   message as a whole.  This information specifies the context of the 
   message.  With this information, the user agent (UA) can optimally 
   present the message to the user in the context she expects. 
    
   In this document, the "message context" is the context the user 
   expects to interact with the message.  For example, a message may be 
   e-mail, voice mail, fax mail, etc.  A smart UA may have specialized 
   behavior based on the context of the message. 
    
   This document specifies a RFC 822 header called "Message-Context".  
   The mechanism is in some ways similar to the use of the Content-
   Disposition MIME entity described in [2].  Content-Disposition gives 
   clues to the receiving User Agent (UA) for how to display a given 
   body part.  Message-Context gives clues to the receiving UA for the 
   context of the message display as a whole.  This allows the 
   receiving UA to present the message in a meaningful and helpful way 
   to the recipient. 
    
   Typical uses for this mechanism include: 
   o    Selecting a special viewer for a given message. 
   o    Selecting an icon indicating the kind of message in a displayed 
        list of messages. 
   o    Arraigning messages in an inbox display. 
   o    Filtering messages the UA presents when the user has limited 
        access. 
 
 
   3. Conventions used in this document 
    
   This document refers generically to the sender of a message in the 
   masculine (he/him/his) and the recipient of the message in the 
   feminine (she/her/hers).  This convention is purely for convenience 
   and makes no assumption about the gender of a message sender or 
   recipient. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3]. 
    
   FORMATTING NOTE: Notes, such at this one, provide additional 
   nonessential information that the reader may skip without missing 
   anything essential.  The primary purpose of these non-essential 
   notes is to convey information about the rationale of this document, 
   or to place this document in the proper historical or evolutionary 
   context.  Readers whose sole purpose is to construct a conformant 
   implementation may skip such information.  However, it may be of use 
   to those who wish to understand why we made certain design choices.

   4. Motivation 
    
   Multimedia messaging systems receive messages that a UA may present 
   in variety of ways.  For example, traditional e-mail uses simple 
   text messages that the recipient displays and edits.  One UA may 
   automatically print Fax images.  Another UA may play voice messages 
   through a telephone handset.  Likewise, a receiving desktop computer 
   may process or present documents transferred over e-mail using a 
   local application.  Emerging and future developments may deliver 
   other forms of information that have their own characteristics for 
   user presentation, such as video messages and short text messages. 
    
   An often-requested characteristic for multimedia messaging systems 
   is to collect received messages in a "universal inbox", and to offer 
   them to the user as a combined list. 
    
   In the context of "unified messaging", different message contexts 
   may have different implied semantics.  For example, some users may 
   perceive voicemail to have an implicit assumption of urgency.  Thus 
   they may wish to gather them together and process them before other 
   messages.  This results in the end-user receiving agent needing to 
   be able to identify voicemail and distinguish it from other 
   messages. 
    
   The uses of this kind of presentation characteristic for each 
   message is multi-fold: 
    
   o    Display an indication to the user (e.g., by a suitably 
        evocative icon along with other summary fields), 
    
   o    Auto-forward a given message type into another messaging 
        environment (e.g., short text to a mobile short message 
        service), 
    
   o    Prioritize and group messages in an inbox display list, 
    
   o    Suggest appropriate default handling for presentation, 
    
   o    Suggest appropriate default handling for reply, forward, etc., 
        and 
    
   o    Filter the message list for presentation via limited-capability 
        user interfaces (e.g., there is no point in offering images 
        when the user is connected by a voice-only telephone user 
        interface). 
    
   A problem faced by multimedia messaging systems is that it is not 
   always easy to decide the context of a received message.  For 
   example, consider the following scenarios. 
    

  
Burger et. al.             Expires 5/24/01                    [Page 4] 
                  Message Context for Internet Mail      November 2000   
 
   o    A message that contains audio and image data:  Is this a fax 
        message that happens to have some voice commentary?  Is it a 
        voice message that is accompanied by some supplementary 
        diagrams?  Is it a fully multimedia message, in which all parts 
        are expected to carry equal significance? 
    
   o    A message containing text and audio data:  Is this e-mail with 
        an MP3 music attachment?  Is it a voice message that happens to 
        have been generated with an initial text header for the benefit 
        of non-voice-enabled e-mail receivers? 
    
   The message context does relate to the message media content.  
   However, it is not the same thing.  As shown above, the media type 
   used in a message is not sufficient to indicate the message context.  
   One cannot determine a priori which media types to use in 
   alternative (gateway) message.  Also, what if the user cares about 
   distinguishing traditional e-mail text from SMS messages?  They are 
   both the same media type, text, but they have different user 
   contexts. 
    
    
   5. Functional Requirements 
    
   The goals stated above lead to the following functional 
   requirements. 
    
   For receivers: 
   o    Identify a message as belonging to a message class. 
    
   o    Incorrect or invalid message classification must not result in 
        failure to transfer or inability to present a message. 
    
    
   For senders: 
   o    Specify message classes by the originating user's choice of 
        authoring tool or simple user interaction. 
    
    
   For both: 
   o    Specify a well-defined set of message classes to make 
        interoperability between mail user agents (UAs) possible. 
    
   o    Message classification information has to be interpretable in 
        reasonable fashion by many different user agent systems. 
    
   o    The mechanism should be extensible to allow for the 
        introduction of new kinds of messages.

   6. Determining the Message Context 
    
   One method of indicating the interpretation context of a message is 
   to examine the media types in the message.  However, this requires 
   the UA to scan the entire message before it can make this 
   determination.  This approach is particularly burdensome for the 
   multi-media mail situation, as voice and especially video mail 
   objects are quite large. 
    
   We considered indicating the message context by registering a 
   multipart/* MIME subtype (Content-Type).  For example, the VPIM Work 
   Group has registered multipart/voice-message to indicate that a 
   message is primarily voice mail [4].  However, multipart/voice-
   message is identical in syntax to multipart/mixed.  The only 
   difference is that VPIM mail transfer agents and user agents 
   recognize that they can perform special handling of the message 
   based on it being a voice mail message.  Moreover, Content-Type 
   refers to a given MIME body part, not to the message as a whole. 
    
   We wish to avoid scanning the entire message.  In addition, we wish 
   to avoid having to create multiple aliases for multipart/mixed every 
   time someone identifies a new primary content type.  Multiple 
   aliases for multipart/mixed are not desirable as they remove the 
   possibility for specifying a message as multipart/alternate, 
   multipart/parallel, or multipart/encrypted, for example. 
    
   Since the message context is an attribute of the entire message, it 
   is logical to define a new top-level (RFC 822 [5]) message 
   attribute.  To this end, this document introduces the message 
   attribute "Message-Context". 
    
   The values for Message-Context MUST be either IANA registered values 
   or experimental, X- tokens.  This ensures that user agents from 
   different vendors will interoperate and perform in a uniform manner 
   without an undue burden on the vendors. 
    
   Message-Context only serves to identify the message context.  It 
   does not provide any indication of content that the UA must be 
   capable of delivering.  It does not imply any message disposition or 
   delivery notification.  There is a related effort to define Critical 
   Content of Internet Mail [6] that one might use to perform these 
   tasks. 
    
   Message-Context is only an indicator.  One can conceive of goofy 
   situations, such as a message marked "voice-message" but without an 
   audio body part.  In this case, the fact that the contents of a 
   message don't match its context MUST NOT generate an error report or 
   fail to deliver or process the message.  
    
    
   7. Message-Context Reference Field

                  Message Context for Internet Mail      November 2000   
 
   The Message-Context reference field is a top-level header inserted 
   by the sending UA to indicate the context of the message. 
    
  7.1. Message-Context Syntax 
    
   The syntax of the Message-Context field, formatted according to the 
   ABNF [7] is as follows.  Note that "Message-Context" is case 
   insensitive, per RFC 822. 
    
        "Message-Context" ":" message-context-class CRLF 
    
  7.2. message-context-class Syntax 
    
   The message-context-class indicates the context of the message.  
   This is an IANA registered value.  Current values for message-
   context-class are as follows. 
    
        message-context-class =  1 *( [ "voice-message"] 
                                      [ "fax-message" ] 
                                      [ "video-message" ] 
                                      [ "short-message" ] 
                                      [ "mail-message" ] 
                                      [ "none" ] 
                                      extension-type ) 
    
        extension-type = token   ; Defined and registered per Section 8 
                       / x-token ; Experimental, private use 
    
        token = <syntax as defined by [8],  
                 but not starting with the characters "X-" or "x-"> 
    
        x-token = <syntax as defined by [8] for private use> 
    
     7.2.1. voice-message 
    
   The voice-message class states the message is a voice message. 
    
     7.2.2. fax-message 
    
   The fax-message class states the message is a facsimile message. 
    
     7.2.3. video-message 
    
   The video-message class states the message is a video message. 
    
     7.2.4. short-message 
    
   The short-message class states the message is a short text message, 
   such as a short text message service (SMS) message or text pager 
   message. 
    

  
Burger et. al.             Expires 5/24/01                    [Page 7] 
                  Message Context for Internet Mail      November 2000   
 
     7.2.5. mail-message 
    
   The mail-message class states the message is a normal internet mail 
   message, with or without attachments. 
    
     7.2.6. none 
    
   The none class states there is no context information for this 
   message.  This class is functionally identical to the mail-message 
   class. 
    
   If a message has no Message-Context reference field, "none" MUST be 
   the default value. 
    
    
   8. Security Considerations 
 
   The intention for this header is to indicate message context only.  
   One can imagine someone creating an "Application" Message-Context.  
   A poorly designed user agent could blindly execute a mailed program 
   based on the Message-Context.  Don't do that! 
    
   One can envision a denial of service attack by bombing a receiver 
   with a message that has a Message-Context that doesn't fit the 
   profile of the actual body parts.  This is why the receiver MUST 
   consider the Message-Context to be a hint only.  The receiver SHOULD 
   NOT rely on the Message-Context exclusively for presentation 
   processing. 
    
    
   9. IANA Considerations 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [9] as "Specification Required", 
   IANA assigns values for Message-Context.

   10. APPENDIX: Some messaging scenarios 
    
   This section is not a normative part of this document.  We include 
   it here as a historical perspective on the issue of multimedia 
   message types. 
    
   These scenarios are neither comprehensive nor fixed.  For example, 
   e-mails being typically text-based do not mean that they cannot 
   convey a voice-message.  This very mutability serves to underline 
   the desirability of providing some explicit message context hint. 
    
  10.1. Internet e-mail 
    
   Internet e-mail carries textual information.  Sometimes it conveys 
   computer application data of arbitrary size. 
    
   Typically, one uses e-mail for non-urgent messages, which the 
   recipient will retrieve and process at a time convenient to her. 
    
   The normal device for receiving and processing e-mail messages is 
   some kind of personal computer.  Modern personal computers usually 
   come with a reasonably large display and an alphanumeric keyboard.  
   Audio, video, and printing capabilities are not necessarily 
   available. 
    
   One can use E-mail for communication between two parties (one-to-
   one), a small number of known parties (one-to-few) or, via an e-mail 
   distribution list, between larger numbers of unknown parties (one-
   to-many). 
    
   One of the endearing characteristics of e-mail is the way that it 
   allows the recipient to forward all or part of the message a to 
   another party, with or without additional comments.  It is quite 
  
Burger et. al.             Expires 5/24/01                   [Page 15] 
                  Message Context for Internet Mail      November 2000   
 
   common for an e-mail to contain snippets of content from several 
   previous messages. Similar features apply when replying to e-mail. 
    
  10.2. Short text messaging service 
    
   One can use a short text message to convey textual information of 
   limited size.  The typical limit is 160 characters. 
    
   The short text messaging service (SMS) is a facility that has 
   evolved for use with mobile telephones, and has an associated per-
   message transmission charge.  People use SMS for relatively urgent 
   messages, which the sender wishes the receiver to see and possibly 
   respond to within a short time period. 
    
   The normal device for sending and receiving a short text message is 
   a mobile telephone with a small character display and a numeric-only 
   keyboard.  Personal computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
   can also participate in short text messaging. 
    
   Currently, the most common use of short text messages are between 
   just two parties (one-to-one). 
    
   Users often send short text messages in isolation, rather than as 
   part of a longer exchange.  One use for them is as a prompt or 
   invitation to communicate by some more convenient and content-rich 
   method, such as a telephone call. 
    
  10.3. Facsimile 
    
   People use facsimile to convey image information of moderate size, 
   typically a small number of pages.  Sometimes people use facsimile 
   for larger documents. 
    
   Facsimile is a facility that usually uses circuit-switched telephone 
   circuits, with connection-time charges.  Message transfer takes 
   place in real-time.  Thus, people often use facsimile for urgent 
   communication. 
    
   The normal device for sending and receiving a facsimile is a self-
   contained scanning and printing device connected to a telephone line 
   or a desktop computer. 
    
   Most facsimiles are between just two parties (one-to-one).  However, 
   a significant portion of facsimile service is broadcast between 
   multiple parties (one-to-many). 
    
   Most facsimile exchanges are in isolation, rather than as part of a 
   longer exchange.  Facsimile data is typically not suitable for 
   further processing by computer.

  10.4. Voice mail 
    
   People use voice mail to convey audio information, almost 
   exclusively human speech. 
    
   Voice mail is a facility that usually uses circuit-switched 
   telephone circuits, with modest connection-time charges, often used 
   for moderately urgent messages.  A common use for them is as a 
   prompt or invitation to communicate by some more convenient method, 
   such as a telephone call. In most, but not all cases, the sender of 
   a voice message does not want to send a message at all.  Rather, 
   they wished to engage in a real-time conversation. 
    
   The normal device for sending and receiving a voice mail is a 
   telephone handset. 
    
   Voice messages are usually sent between just two parties (one-to-
   one). 
    
   Voice mail data is not generally suitable for further processing by 
   computer. 
    
  10.5. Multimedia message 
    
   We define a multimedia message as a message containing more than one 
   basic media type (text, image, audio, video, model, application). 
    
   The following are some characteristics of a multimedia message. 
    
   In some cases, a multimedia message is just e-mail with an 
   attachment that a multimedia display application presents.  For 
   example, I can send you an MP3 of something I recorded in my garage 
   today. 
    
   In other cases, a multimedia message represents a convergence 
   between two or more of the scenarios described above.  For example, 
   a voice message with an accompanying diagram or a talking head video 
   message is a multimedia message. 
    
   The characteristics will vary somewhat with the intent of the 
   sender.  This in turn may affect the user agent or application used 
   to render the message.
