                             Abstract

This memo contains tables of commonly occurring header
fields in headings of e-mail messages. The document
compiles information from other RFCs such as RFC 822, RFC
1036, RFC 1123, RFC 2156, RFC 1496, RFC 1766, RFC 2183, RFC
1864, RFC 2421 and RFC 2045. A few commonly occurring
header fields which are not defined in RFCs are also
included. For each header field, the memo gives a short
description and a reference to the RFC in which the header
field is defined.

The latest, revised version of this document can be found

                          1. Introduction

Many different Internet standards and RFCs define header
fields which may occur on Internet Mail Messages and Usenet
News Articles. The intention of this document is to list
all such header fields in one document as an aid to people
developing message systems or interested in Internet Mail
standards.

The document contains all header fields which the author
has found in the following Internet standards: RFC 822 [2],
RFC 1036 [3], RFC 1123 [5], RFC 2156 [7], RFC 1496 [8], RFC
2045 [11], RFC 1766 [12], RFC 2183 [14], RFC 1864[17] and
RFC 2421[20]. Note in particular that heading attributes
defined in PEM (RFC 1421-1424) and MOSS (RFC 1848 [16]) are
not included. PEM and MOSS header fields only appear inside
the body of a message, and thus are not header fields in
the RFC 822 sense. Mail attributes in envelopes, i.e.
attributes controlling the message transport mechanism
between mail and news servers, are not included. This means
that attributes from SMTP [1], UUCP [18] and NNTP [15] are
mainly not covered either. Headings used only in HTTP [19]
are not included yet, but may be included in future version
of this memo. Some additional header fields which often can
be found in e-mail headings but are not part of any
Internet standard are also included.

The author does not promise that this document contains a
complete list of all heading fields which are specified in
any standard or used by any mailer.

For each header field, the document gives a short
description and a reference to the Internet standard or
RFC, in which they are defined.

The header field names given here are spelled the same way
as when they are actually used. This is usually American
but sometimes English spelling.  One header field in
particular, "Organisation/Organization", occurs in e-mail
header fields sometimes with the English and other times
with the American spelling.

The following words are used in this memo with the meaning
specified below:

heading        Formatted text at the top of a message,
                ended by a blank line

header field   One field in the heading, beginning with a
                field name, colon, and followed by the
                field value(s). The words "heading field"
                and "header" are also sometimes used with
                this meaning.

It is my intention to continue updating this document after
its publication as an RFC. The latest version, which may be
more up-to-date (but also less fully checked out) will be
kept available for downloading from URL
http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/ietf/mail-headers

Please e-mail me (Jacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se>) if you
have noted header fields which should be included in this
memo but are not.


                  2. Use of gatewaying header fields

RFC 2156 defines a number of new header fields in Internet
mail, which are defined to map header fields which X.400
has but which were previously not standardized in Internet
mail. The fact that a header field occurs in RFC 2156
indicates that it is recommended for use in gatewaying
messages between X.400 and Internet mail, but does not mean
that the header field is recommended for messages wholly
within Internet mail. Some of these header fields may
eventually see widespread implementation and use in
Internet mail, but at the time of this writing (2001) they
are not widely implemented or used.

Header fields defined only in RFC 1036 for use in Usenet
News sometimes appear in mail messages, either because the
messages have been gatewayed from Usenet News to e-mail, or
because the messages were written in combined clients
supporting both e-mail and Usenet News in the same client.
These header fields are not standardized for use in
Internet e-mail and should be handled with caution by e-
mail agents.


                       3. Table of header fields

**** 3.1 Phrases used in the tables

"not for general    Used to mark header fields which are
usage"              defined in RFC 2156 for use in
                     messages from or to Internet
                     mail/X.400 gateways. These header
                     fields have not been standardized for
                     general usage in the exchange of
                     messages between Internet mail-based
                     systems.

"not standardized   Used to mark header fields defined
for use in e-       only in RFC 1036 for use in Usenet
mail"               News. These header fields have no
                     standard meaning when appearing in e-
                     mail, some of them may even be used in
                     different ways by different software.
                     When appearing in e-mail, they should
                     be handled with caution. Note that RFC
                     1036, although generally used as a de-
                     facto standard for Usenet News, is not
                     an official IETF standard or even on
                     the IETF standards track.

"non-standard"      This header field is not specified in
                     any of referenced RFCs which define
                     Internet protocols, including Internet
                     Standards, draft standards or proposed
                     standards. The header field appears
                     here because it often appears in e-
                     mail or Usenet News. Usage of these
                     header fields is not in general
                     recommended. Some header field
                     proposed in ongoing IETF standards
                     development work, but not yet
                     accepted, are also marked in this way.

"discouraged"       This header field, which is non-
                     standard, is known to create problems
                     and should not be generated. Handling
                     of such header fields in incoming mail
                     should be done with great caution.

"controversial"     The meaning and usage of this header
                     field is controversial, i.e. different
                     implementors have chosen to implement
                     the header field in different ways.
                     Because of this, such header fields
                     should be handled with caution and
                     understanding of the different
                     possible interpretations.

"experimental"      This header field is used for newly
                     defined header fields, which are to be
                     tried out before entering the IETF
                     standards track. These should only be
                     used if both communicating parties
                     agree on using them. In practice, some
                     experimental protocols become de-facto-
                     standards before they are made into
                     IETF standards.

appear in this memo. It is                  mail
however included, since
people often ask about it.

This header field is used in
the so-called Unix mailbox
format, also known as
Berkely mailbox format or
the MBOX format. This is a
format for storing a set of
messages in a file. A line
beginning with "From " is
used to separate successive
messages in such files.

This header field will thus
appear when you use a text
editor to look at a file in
the Unix mailbox format.
Some mailers also use this
format when printing
messages on paper.

The information in this
header field should NOT be
used to find an address to
which replies to a message
are to be sent.

Some mail software expect     X-Sender:     Non-standard
"Sender:" to be an e-mail
address which you can send
mail to. However, some mail
software has as the best
authenticated sender a POP
or IMAP account, which you
might not be able to send
to. Because of this, some
mail software put the POP or
IMAP account into an X-
sender header field instead
of a Sender header field, to
indicate that you may not be
able to send e-mail to this
address. See also "X-X-
Sender".

Another use of" X-Sender:"
is that some e-mail
software, which wants to
insert a "Sender:" header,
will first change an
existing "Sender:" header to
"X-Sender". This use is
actually often the same as
that described in the
previous paragraph, since
the new "Sender:" is added
because it is better
authenticated than the old
value.

Even though some systems put  X-X-Sender:   Non-standard
the POP or IMAP account name
into the "X-Sender:" instead
of the Sender header field,
some mail software tries to
send to the "X-Sender:" too.
To stop this, some systems
have begun to use "X-X-
Sender:" to indicate an
authentication of the sender
which might not be useable
to send e-mail to. See also
"Originator-Info:"

When a message is sent both   Posted-To:    Non-standard
to netnews and e-mail, this
header is used in the e-mail
version of the message to
indicate which newsgroup it
was sent to. This header
thus contains the same
information as the
"Newsgroups:" header in the
netnews version of the
message.

The most common usage is
when an article is posted to
several newsgroups, and
further discussions is to
take place in only one of
them.

In e-mail, this header field
may occur in a message which
is sent to both e-mail and
Usenet News, to show where
follow-up in Usenet news is
wanted. The header field
does not say anything about
where follow-up in e-mail is
to be sent.

wants replies to go.                        controversial.
Unfortunately, this is
ambiguous, since there are
different kinds of replies,
which the sender may wish to
go to different addresses.
In particular, there are
personal replies intended
for only one person, and
group replies, intended for
the whole group of people
who read the replied-to
message (often a mailing
list, anewsgroup name cannot
appear here because of
different syntax, see
"Followup-To" below.).

Some mail systems use this    Reply-To2
header field to indicate a
better form of the e-mail
address of the sender. Some
mailing list expanders puts
the name of the list in this
header field. These
practices are controversial.
The personal opinion of the
author of this RFC is that
this header field should be
avoided except in special
cases, but this is a
personal opinion not shared
by all specialists in the
area.
