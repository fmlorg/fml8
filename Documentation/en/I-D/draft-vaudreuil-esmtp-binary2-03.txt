This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol) service.  The first extension enables a SMTP client and
server to negotiate the use of an alternative to the DATA command,
called "BDAT", for efficiently sending large MIME (Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions) messages.  The second extension takes
advantage of the BDAT command to permit the negotiated sending of MIME
messages that employ the binary transfer encoding.  This document is
intended to update and obsolete RFC 1830.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.
