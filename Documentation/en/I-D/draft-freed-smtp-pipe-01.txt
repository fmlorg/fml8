This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) service whereby a server can indicate the extent of its ability
to accept multiple commands in a single Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) send operation. Using a single TCP send operation for multiple
commands can improve SMTP performance significantly.

This is now a Standard Protocol.
