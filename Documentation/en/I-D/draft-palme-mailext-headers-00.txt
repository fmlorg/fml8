                         1. Introduction

Many different Internet standards and RFCs define header fields which
may occur on Internet Mail Messages and Usenet News Articles. The
intention of this document is to list all such header fields in one
document as an aid to people developing message systems or interested
in Internet Mail standards.

The document contains all header fields which the author has
found in the following Internet standards: RFC 822 [2],
RFC 1036 [3], RFC 1123 [5], RFC 1327 [7], RFC 1496 [8], RFC 2045 [11],
RFC 1766 [12], RFC 1806 [14], RFC 1864[17] and RFC 1911[20]. Note in
particular that heading attributes defined in PEM (RFC 1421-1424) and
MOSS (RFC 1848 [16]) are not included. PEM and MOSS header fields only
appear inside the body of a message, and thus are not header fields in
the RFC 822 sense. Mail attributes in envelopes, i.e. attributes
controlling the message transport mechanism between mail and news
servers, are not included. This means that attributes from SMTP [1],
UUCP [18] and NNTP [15] are mainly not covered either. Headings used
only in HTTP [19] are not included yet, but may be included in future
version of this memo. Some additional header fields which often can be
found in e-mail headings but are not part of any Internet standard are
also included.

For each header field, the document gives a short description and
a reference to the Internet standard or RFC, in which they are defined.

The header field names given here are spelled the same way as when they
are actually used. This is usually American but sometimes English
spelling.  One header field in particular, "Organisation/Organization",
occurs in e-mail header fields sometimes with the English and other
times with the American spelling.

The following words are used in this memo with the meaning specified
below:

heading           Formatted text at the top of a message, ended by a
                  blank line

header field      One field in the heading, beginning with a field
                  name, colon, and followed by the field value(s). The
                  words "heading field" and "header" are also
                  sometimes used with this meaning.

It is my intention to continue updating this document after its
publication as an RFC. The latest version, which may be more up-to-date
(but also less fully checked out) will be kept available for
downloading from URL
http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/ietf-mail-attributes.html.

Please e-mail me (Jacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se>) if you have noted
header fields which should be included in this memo but are not.


                 2. Use of gatewaying header fields

RFC 1327 defines a number of new header fields in Internet mail, which
are defined to map header fields which X.400 has but which were
previously not standardized in Internet mail. The fact that a header
field occurs in RFC 1327 indicates that it is recommended for use in
gatewaying messages between X.400 and Internet mail, but does not mean
that the header field is recommended for messages wholly within
Internet mail. Some of these header fields may eventually see
widespread implementation and use in Internet mail, but at the time of
this writing (1996) they are not widely implemented or used.

Header fields defined only in RFC 1036 for use in Usenet News sometimes
appear in mail messages, either because the messages have been
gatewayed from Usenet News to e-mail, or because the messages were
written in combined clients supporting both e-mail and Usenet News in
the same client. These header fields are not standardized for use in
Internet e-mail and should be handled with caution by e-mail agents.



                      3. Table of header fields

3.1 Phrases used in the tables


"not for general        Used to mark header fields which are defined
usage"                  in RFC 1327 for use in messages from or to
                        Internet mail/X.400 gateways. These header
                        fields have not been standardized for general
                        usage in the exchange of messages between
                        Internet mail-based systems.

"not standardized       Used to mark header fields defined only in RFC
for use in e-mail"      1036 for use in Usenet News. These header
                        fields have no standard meaning when appearing
                        in e-mail, some of them may even be used in
                        different ways by different software. When
                        appearing in e-mail, they should be handled
                        with caution. Note that RFC 1036, although
                        generally used as a de-facto standard for
                        Usenet News, is not an official IETF standard
                        or even on the IETF standards track.

"non-standard"          This header field is not specified in any of
                        referenced RFCs which define Internet
                        protocols, including Internet Standards, draft
                        standards or proposed standards. The header
                        field appears here because it often appears in
                        e-mail or Usenet News. Usage of these header
                        fields is not in general recommended. Some
                        header field proposed in ongoing IETF
                        standards development work, but not yet
                        accepted, are also marked in this way.

"discouraged"           This header field, which is non-standard, is
                        known to create problems and should not be
                        generated. Handling of such header fields in
                        incoming mail should be done with great
                        caution.

"controversial"         The meaning and usage of this header field is
                        controversial, i.e. different implementors
                        have chosen to implement the header field in
                        different ways. Because of this, such header
                        fields should be handled with caution and
                        understanding of the different possible
                        interpretations.

"experimental"          This header field is used for newly defined
                        header fields, which are to be tried out
                        before entering the IETF standards track.
                        These should only be used if both
                        communicating parties agree on using them. In
                        practice, some experimental protocols become
                        de-facto-standards before they are made into
                        IETF standards.

3.4 Sender and recipient indication

Authors or persons taking            From:           RFC 822: 4.4.1,
responsibility for the message.                      RFC 1123: 5.2.15-
                                                     16, 5.3.7,
Note difference from the "From "                     RFC 1036 2.1.1
header field (not followed by
":") below.


(1) This header field should         From (not       not standardized
never appear in e-mail being         followed by a   for use in e-mail
sent, and should thus not appear     colon)
in this memo. It is however
included, since people often ask
about it.

This header field is used in the
so-called Unix mailbox format,
also known as Berkely mailbox
format or the MBOX format. This
is a format for storing a set of
messages in a file. A line
beginning with "From " is used to
separate successive messages in
such files.

This header field will thus
appear when you use a text editor
to look at a file in the Unix
mailbox format. Some mailers also
use this format when printing
messages on paper.

The information in this header
field should NOT be used to find
an address to which replies to a
message are to be sent.

(2) Used in Usenet News mail         From            RFC 976: 2.4 for

Sometimes called "From_" header
field.

Name of the moderator of the         Approved:       RFC 1036: 2.2.11,
newsgroup to which this article                      not standardized

certain control messages, which
are only performed if they are
marked as Approved.

other than shown by the From:                        16, 5.3.7.
header field. Should be
authenticated,
according to RFC 822, but what
kind of authentication is not
clear. Some implementations
expect that the e-mail address
used in this field can be used to
reach the sender, others do not.
See also "X-Sender".

Some mail software expect            X-Sender:       Non-standard
"Sender:" to be an e-mail address
which you can send mail to.
However, some mail software has
as the best authenticated sender
a POP or IMAP account, which you
might not be able to send to.
Because of this, some mail
software put the POP or IMAP
account into an X-sender header
field instead of a Sender header
field, to indicate that you may
not be able to send e-mail to
this address. See also "X-X-
Sender".

Another use of" X-Sender:" is
that some e-mail software, which
wants to insert a "Sender:"
header, will first change an
existing "Sender:" header to "X-
Sender". This use is actually
often the same as that described
in the previous paragraph, since
the new "Sender:" is added
because it is better
authenticated than the old value.

Even though some systems put the     X-X-Sender:     Non-standard
POP or IMAP account name into the
"X-Sender:" instead of the Sender
header field, some mail software
tries to send to the "X-Sender:"
too. To stop this, some systems
have begun to use "X-X-Sender:"
to indicate an authentication of
the sender which might not be
useable to send e-mail to. See
also "Originator-Info:"

used to send email to, to avoid
the problems with "Sender" and "X-
Sender".

3.5 Response control

This header field is meant to        Reply-To:       RFC 822: 4.4.3,
indicate where the sender wants                      RFC 1036: 2.2.1
replies to go. Unfortunately,                        controversial.
this is ambiguous, since there
are different kinds of replies,
which the sender may wish to go
to different addresses. In
particular, there are personal
replies intended for only one
person, and group replies,
intended for the whole group of
people who read the replied-to
message (often a mailing list,
anewsgroup name cannot appear
here because of different syntax,
see "Followup-To" below.).

Some mail systems use this header
field to indicate a better form
of the e-mail address of the
sender. Some mailing list
expanders puts the name of the
list in this header field. These
practices are controversial. The
personal opinion of the author of
this RFC is that this header
field should be avoided except in
special cases, but this is a
personal opinion not shared by
all specialists in the area.

Used in Usenet News to indicate      Followup-To:    RFC 1036: 2.2.3,

different set of newsgroups than
the replied-to article. The most
common usage is when an article
is posted to several newsgroups,
and further discussions is to
take place in only one of them.

In e-mail, this header field may
occur in a message which is sent
to both e-mail and Usenet News,
to show where follow-up in Usenet
news is wanted. The header field
does not say anything about where
follow-up in e-mail is to be
sent.

Note that the value of this
header field must always be one
or more newsgroup names, never e-
mail addresses.
