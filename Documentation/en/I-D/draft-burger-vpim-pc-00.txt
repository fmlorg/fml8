  Conventions used in this document

   This document refers generically to the sender of a message in the
   masculine (he/him/his) and the recipient of the message in the
   feminine (she/her/hers).  This convention is purely for convenience
   and makes no assumption about the gender of a message sender or
   recipient.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

   FORMATTING NOTE: Notes, such at this one, provide additional
   nonessential information that the reader may skip without missing
   anything essential.  The primary purpose of these non-essential
   notes is to convey information about the rationale of this document,
   or to place this document in the proper historical or evolutionary
   context.  Readers whose sole purpose is to construct a conformant
   implementation may skip such information.  However, it may be of use
   to those who wish to understand why we made certain design choices.

  Introduction

   This document describes the Primary Content identification for
   multi-part Internet mail.




Burger and Candell         Expires 12/6/00                    [Page 2]

                   Primary Content of Internet Mail           May 2000



   There is a need for a method of indicating to a User Agent (UA) that
   the sender or sending system designates that a particular message is
   primarily of some type.  For example, some clients put a little fax
   or telephone icon next to a message header in the client application
   to indicate of the message is fax mail or voice mail, respectively.
   In addition, some clients will launch helper applications that are
   appropriate to a particular type of primary message type.  This is a
   different approach than the usual method of launching a helper
   application based on one of the (many) media types in the message.

   One method of indicating the primary media content of a message is
   to examine the media types in the message.  However, this requires
   the UA to scan the entire message before making this determination.
   This is particularly burdensome for the multi-media mail situation,
   as voice and especially video mail objects are quite large.

   Another method of indicating the primary media content of a message
   is to register a multipart/* MIME subtype.  For example, the VPIM
   Work Group has registered multipart/voice-message to indicate that a
   message is primarily voice mail [3].  However, multipart/voice-
   message is identical in syntax to multipart/mixed.  The only
   difference is that VPIM mail transfer agents and user agents
   recognize that they can perform special handling of the message
   based on it being a voice mail message.

   We wish to avoid scanning the entire message.  In addition, we wish
   to avoid having to create multiple aliases for multipart/mixed every
   time someone identifies a new primary content type.

   Since the Primary Content indicator is an attribute of the entire
   message, it is logical to define a new top-level (RFC 822 [4])
   message attribute, Primary-Content.

   Primary-Content only serves to identify the primary content type of
   the message.  It does not provide any indication of content that the
   UA must be capable of delivering.  It does not imply any message
   disposition or delivery notification.  See the companion document,
   Critical Content of Internet Mail [5], for a mechanism to perform
   these tasks.

   Since Primary-Content is only an indicator, goofy situations, such
   as a message marked "voice-message" but without a voice body part,
   MUST NOT generate any error report.


4.
  Primary-Content Reference Field

   The Primary-Content reference field is a top-level header inserted
   by the sending UA to indicate the primary content type of the
   message.



Burger and Candell         Expires 12/6/00                    [Page 3]

                   Primary Content of Internet Mail           May 2000



  4.1. Primary-Content Syntax

   The syntax of the Primary-Content field, formatted according to the
   ABNF [6] is as follows.  Note that "Primary-Content" is not case
   sensitive, per RFC 822.

        "Primary-Content" ":" content-type CRLF

  4.2. content-type Syntax

   The content-type indicates the primary media content type of the
   message.  This is an IANA registered value.  Current values for
   Primary-Content are as follows.

        content-type =  1 *( [ "voice-message"]
                             [ "fax-message" ]
                             [ "video-message" ]
                             [ "text-message" ] )



5.
  Security Considerations

   The intention for this header is to indicate media content type
   only. One can imagine one creating an "Application" primary content
   type, and have a poorly designed user agent blindly execute a mailed
   program.

   Don't do that!


6.
  IANA Considerations

   NOTE: We won't send in any registrations until it looks like this
   will become a RFC!

   Following the policies outlined in [7], IANA assigns values for
   Primary-Content as Specification Required.

  6.1. Primary-Content Registration

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of New Top-Level Header Field Primary-Content

   Header name:
   Primary-Content

   Required parameters:
   Single 7bit text value

   Parameter value:

                   Primary Content of Internet Mail           May 2000



   The parameter value specifies the primary media content type for the
   message.

   Security considerations:
   The intention for this header is to indicate media content type
   only. One can imagine one creating an "Application" primary content
   type, and have a poorly designed user agent blindly execute a mailed
   program.
