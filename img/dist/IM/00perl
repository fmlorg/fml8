			      Perl5 FAQ

			<<<Obtaining Perl5>>>

You can find the latest and greatest release of Perl5 from the
following CPAN URL, which directs you to the nearest site from you
maybe:

	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/5.0/

			<<<Installing Perl5>>>

(1) Type "./Configure -d" to let "Configure" check your system
configuration. The "-d" option lets Perl5 choose default values rather
than asking questions to you. "Configure" creates the "config.sh" file
as a result.

	% cd _somewhere_perl5_locates_
	% ./Configure -d

(2) Edit "config.sh" at the final stage of "Configure" using shell escape.

	e.g.	!vi config.sh

If you want to use RPOP, "sperl" is required. To gain "sperl", ensure
that "d_dosuid" is 'defined' in "config.sh".

	e.g.	d_dosuid='define'

Unfortunately dynamic loading doesn't work on some OSes. In this case, 
ensure that Perl5 uses static loading instead.

	e.g.	dynamic_ext=''
		static_ext='DB_File Fcntl IO NDBM_File Opcode POSIX SDBM_File Socket'

You may want to modify "libs" to pacify warning concerned with locale. 
See below.

(3) When you finish editing, "Configure" reflects "config.sh" to all
Makefiles and etc. Then type "make", "make test", and "make install".

	% make
	% make test
	% su
	# make install


		    <<<Pacifying Perl5 Warning>>>

Perl5 warns if appropriate locale for "LANG" is not found.

On FreeBSD, you should link Perl5 to the "xpg4" library. This is
accomplished by adding "-libxpg4" to "libs" in "config.sh". An example
is as follows:

	libs='-lxpg4 -lm -lc -lcrypt'

Ensure that "-lxpg4" is on the top of the list. Of course, you need to
reflect this modification to all sub-directory files and make Perl5.

Even if your Perl5 is locale ready, Perl5 warns. This is because path
is missing.

Suppose that you set "LANG" "japanese" on BSD/OS 3.0. Perl5 warns as
follows:

	warning: setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "") failed.
	warning: LC_ALL = "(null)", LC_CTYPE = "(null)", LANG = "japanese",
	warning: falling back to the "C" locale.

The best solution is to create an alias link to one of existing
locales. For instance, BSD/OS has /usr/share/locale/Japanese-EUC. So,
create "japanese" link, which is the value of "LANG", to it.

	% su
	# cd /usr/share/locale
	# ln -s Japanese-EUC japanese
