# fml8 mailing list management software

*fml* version 8 is a mailing list management software,

It has beed developed from scratch to rewrite fml4 (fml version 4).
The relationship between fml4 and fml8 is similar to 
one between sendmail and Postfix but the author is same in our case.

fml8 version number is yet 7.98.xx (like ancient openssl ? ;_;)
though fml8 has been stable under normal operation.

Our plan in this year is to assign v8.0.0 to fml8.
